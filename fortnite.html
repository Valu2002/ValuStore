            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Fortnite is an online video game and game platform developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is
                available in six distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game
                engine: Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be
                the last person standing; Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative hybrid tower defense-shooter and
                survival game in which up to four players fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with traps
                and fortifications they can build; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to
                create worlds and battle arenas, Lego Fortnite, an open world survival game, Rocket Racing, a racing
                game, and Fortnite Festival, a rhythm game.

                Save the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was
                released on December 6, 2018. While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful for
                Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became an overwhelming success and a cultural
                phenomenon, drawing more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of
                dollars per month. Fortnite as a whole generated $9 billion in gross revenue up until December 2019, and
                it has been listed among the greatest games of all time.

                Save the World is available for macOS,[c] PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One, while Battle Royale and
                Creative were released for all those platforms as well as Android and iOS devices[c] and Nintendo
                Switch. The game also launched with the release of the ninth-generation PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series
                X/S consoles. Furthermore, Lego Fortnite, Rocket Racing and Fortnite Festival are available on all
                platforms.</p>

        <details class="descriere">
            <summary>Game modes</summary>
            <p>Fortnite has multiple game modes, using the same engine; each has similar graphics and art assets. Five
                of these modes are directly created and managed by Epic Games and its subsidiaries:</p>

            <p>-Fortnite: Save the World is a player-versus-environment cooperative game, with four players
                collaborating towards a common objective on various missions while avoiding the effects of an
                encroaching cataclysmic storm. The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting
                resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that helps to either collect data on the storm or
                to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero
                characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained
                experience to improve their attributes.</p>

            <p>-Fortnite Battle Royale is a player-versus-player game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone,
                in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players airdrop from a
                "Battle Bus" that crosses the game's map, and then scavenge for weapons, items, and resources while
                trying to stay alive and to attack and eliminate other players. Over the course of a round, the safe
                area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take
                damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into
                tighter spaces and encourages player encounters until the last player or team is alive.</p>

            <p>-Lego Fortnite is a survival sandbox game, where players play as Lego Minifig versions of characters, as
                they collect materials, build various buildings, craft various weapons and tools and fight against
                monsters.</p>

            <p>-Rocket Racing is a racing game, developed by Psyonix and serving as a spin-off title to Rocket League.
                Players race vehicles, gaining speed boosts from special lanes sections or by drifting, as well as the
                ability to jump and racing on vertical and inverted surfaces, while avoiding obstacles on the course.
            </p>

            <p>-Fortnite Festival is a rhythm game developed by Harmonix, consisting of three modes. In the "Main
                Stage", players play popular hit songs and original tracks created by Harmonix and the Epic Games Sound
                Team, hitting notes to the rhythm in the Main Stage on one of the four unique parts: Lead, Guitar/Bass,
                Drums and Vocals, in a manner similar to Harmonix's Rock Band games, while the "Battle Stage" pits
                sixteen players to get the highest score and survive each round until one player remains.[4] In the "Jam
                Stage", players cooperate to make remixes, similar to Harmonix' Dropmix and Fuser, using any part of any
                song within Festival mode, in which are also usable in Battle Royale, Creative and Unreal Editor for
                Fortnite (UEFN).</p>

            <p>In addition to these modes, Fortnite offers the sandbox mode, Fortnite Creative. Within this mode,
                players are given complete freedom to spawn any item from the Battle Royale gamemode on a personal
                island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses, platforming challenges, and more.
                Furthermore, it also supports Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), which allows players to edit worlds
                using Fortnite assets.</p>

            <p>All modes except Save the World are free-to-play; Save the World is pay-to-play.[5] The games are
                monetized through the use of V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but
                also earned through completing missions and other achievements in Save the World.[6] In other modes,
                V-Bucks can be used to buy cosmetic items such as character models or the game's battle pass, a tiered
                progression of customization rewards for gaining experience and completing certain objectives during the
                course of a Battle Royale season.[7][8] All modes of Fortnite are cross-platform play compatible,
                requiring users to use an Epic Games account for cross-saving between platforms.[9]
