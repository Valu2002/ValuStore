            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>In 2020, the unexplained strengthening of Earth's magnetic field negatively affects the planet. Layla
                Hassan, Shaun Hastings, and Rebecca Crane receive a signal with coordinates in New England, where they
                exhume a Viking raider's remains. Layla, struggling with the Staff of Hermes Trismegistus' influence,
                enters the Animus to view the raider's memories.

                In 855 CE in Norway, a young Eivor Varinsdottir witnesses warlord Kjotve the Cruel sacking her hometown
                and killing her parents before she is rescued by Sigurd, son of King Styrbjorn of the Raven Clan.
                Seventeen years later, Eivor has been adopted by Styrbjorn, and pursues vengeance against Kjotve. Her
                latest attempt fails, but she recovers her father's axe. Touching it, Eivor experiences a vision of
                Odin, leading her to consult the local seeress, Valka. Valka induces another vision of Sigurd losing an
                arm before being consumed by a giant wolf.

                Sigurd returns from an expedition with foreigners Basim and Hytham, members of the Hidden Ones, who came
                to Norway to assassinate Kjotve, a member of the opposing Order of the Ancients. Defying Styrbjorn's
                orders, Eivor and Sigurd enlist King Harald's help to eliminate Kjotve. Following their victory, Harald
                declares his intention to unite Norway under his rule. Styrbjorn pledges fealty to Harald, angering
                Sigurd, who expected to inherit the crown. He and Eivor take loyalists in the clan on an exodus to
                England, where they establish their own settlement, which they name Ravensthorpe.

                After setting up their town and aiding merchants, blacksmiths and fishermen establish their businesses,
                Eivor helps Hytham set up the Hidden Ones Bureau in Ravensthorpe, where Hytham tasks Eivor with tracking
                down and assassinating various members of the Order of Ancients. Eivor then helps a fellow Viking
                Jarlskona named Soma to reclaim the town of Grantebridge, which was taken from Soma by Saxon warriors
                under the command of Wigmund of Mercia. Eivor also helps Soma identify a traitor who allowed Wigmund's
                forces into the town. Later, Eivor secures other alliances with neighboring Saxon kingdoms and Viking
                clans led by Ivar, Halfdan, Ubba Ragnarsson, Oswald of East Anglia, Guthrum, and Ceolwulf of Mercia, and
                helps Hytham assassinate more Order members, following tip-offs from a "Poor Fellow-Soldier of Christ."

                Eivor's visions continue. Valka gives her an elixir that makes her dream of Asgard from Odin's
                perspective. Hoping to avert his own fated death during Ragnarök, Odin imprisons Loki's son Fenrir, who
                is foretold to kill him, and retrieves a magical mead from Jotunheim that will allow him and the other
                Aesir to be reincarnated. Layla realizes these are actually visions of the Isu shortly before the Great
                Catastrophe, and that Loki, who was forbidden to reincarnate himself after betraying Odin, found another
                way to ensure his survival.

                Sigurd and Basim discover an Isu relic, and Sigurd, with Basim's encouragement, comes to believe himself
                a god. Fulke, an Order agent and servant of King Alfred of Wessex, captures Sigurd, believing him to be
                an Isu or descendant thereof, and tortures him, removing his right arm. Eivor rallies her allies to kill
                Fulke and rescue Sigurd, who has also begun experiencing strange visions. Eivor later accompanies Sigurd
                back to Norway to investigate his visions, finding an Isu temple with a tree-shaped computer system. The
                siblings connect themselves to it and are seemingly transported to Valhalla, where they enjoy endless
                battles, until Eivor realizes it is just a simulation. Having become disillusioned with the pursuit of
                glory, Eivor persuades Sigurd to return to the real world, and escapes the simulation after resisting
                Odin.

                Upon awakening, Eivor is confronted by Basim, who reveals himself, Eivor, and Sigurd to be
                reincarnations of Loki, Odin, and Tyr, respectively. Having been overtaken by Loki's personality, Basim
                attacks Eivor, but is defeated and trapped in the simulation. Sigurd then abdicates leadership of the
                clan to Eivor, who returns to England. Later, Eivor and her allies join Guthrum's assault on Wessex,
                defeating Alfred's forces at the Battle of Chippenham. Eivor tracks down Alfred, who reveals himself as
                both the leader of the Order and the "Poor Fellow-Soldier of Christ." Disgusted by the Order's heresy
                against Christianity, Alfred sought to replace it with a new God-fearing order. Eivor spares Alfred and
                returns to Ravensthorpe to a hero's welcome.

                In the present, the Assassins deduce the strengthening magnetic field is a result of Desmond Miles'
                activation of the Isu towers in 2012. To stabilize the field, Layla travels to the Norway temple and
                enters the simulation. She meets Basim, who reveals that he led the Assassins to Eivor, and tells her
                how to stabilize the magnetic field. She does so, but this releases Basim and traps Layla in the
                simulation. Layla encounters a being called "the Reader," and decides to work with him to prevent future
                disasters, allowing her mortal body to die. Meanwhile, Basim escapes the temple with the Staff of
                Hermes—containing the consciousness of Loki's lover, Aletheia—and meets Shaun and Rebecca. After they
                leave to bring William Miles, Basim enters the Animus to track down Loki's missing children.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Assassin's Creed Valhalla is an action role-playing video game structured around several main story arcs
                and numerous optional side-missions, called "World Events". The player takes on the role of Eivor
                Varinsdottir (/ˈeɪvɔːr/),[6] a Viking raider, as they lead their fellow Vikings against the Anglo-Saxon
                kingdoms. The player has the choice of playing Eivor as either female or male (voiced by Cecilie
                Stenspil and Magnus Bruun respectively),[7] or letting the game alternate between the two at key moments
                in the story (with the female avatar depicting Eivor's life[d] and the male avatar depicting the
                physical appearance of the Isu Odin, due to his connection with Eivor).[8] The player is also able to
                customize Eivor's hair, beard, war paint, clothing, armor, and tattoos.[9] The variety of weapons
                available to the player has been expanded to include weapons such as flails and greatswords. Combat has
                been changed to allow dual-wielding of almost any weapon, including shields,[5] and every piece of gear
                that the player collects is unique.[1] The Eagle Vision mechanic of previous titles returns in the form
                of "Odin Sight".[10] The player's companion animal is a raven named Sýnin[11] (Old Norse for
                "insight")[12][e] who can be used to scout the nearby areas, much like previous avian companions had
                done in Assassin's Creed Origins and Odyssey, and other parts of the game world from afar before Eivor
                engages in combat.[13] There is more focus on the stealth aspects for both traversing the game world and
                in combat. The "social stealth" concept from earlier Assassin's Creed games returns: Eivor can hide from
                enemies not only in stationary environmental objects but can pull down the hood and slip into certain
                crowds to use them as cover. Eivor can feign death, use her raven to distract guards, and can access a
                hidden blade for near-instantaneous assassinations. Most of the game's enemies, through specific
                combinations of approaches, tactics, and weapon selection, are able to be assassinated through a single
                attack, with the notable exception of bosses, but still can be defeated through numerous other
                routes.[14]

                Valhalla has a familiar structure of main story missions and a number of optional side-missions. While
                the main storyline in past Assassin's Creed games typically moved linearly through the main sections of
                the game world, Valhalla has the player often returning to the main settlement and back to areas
                previously visited as information about the new areas of England is learned by the Vikings through
                reconnaissance or from contacts. Not all missions require violent ends, with some that can be resolved
                through diplomatic means.[15] Player choices through conversation or gameplay options will affect the
                characters and their political alliances with other non-player characters.[5] The game also relies less
                on a traditional leveling system and instead focuses more on the selection of skills through skill trees
                selected by the player as Eivor advances through the game. The difficulty posed by enemies is rated
                based on the player's collection of skills.[5] The development team aimed to introduce a wider range of
                enemy archetypes to Valhalla than in previous titles as they wanted the player to be continually
                surprised by the game even after playing for tens of hours.[5] Narrative director Darby McDevitt said
                that the game has 25 unique enemy archetypes, and each "has a unique way of challenging the player."
                Enemies can also use objects in the environment to their advantage. Some enemies are also capable of
                adapting to the player's actions and combat and finding ways to defend themselves. Enemies can also show
                personality during combat. While some might be intimidated by Eivor and fight more defensively, others
                might be more aggressive in their approach.[16]

                Conquest Battles, a feature introduced to the series in Odyssey, return in the form of "Assaults" which
                see the player lead armies to attack fortresses.[5] "Raids" are smaller engagements where the player
                leads a raiding party to attack a target and secure resources for their settlement.[5] The player is
                able to build a raiding party by recruiting non-player characters to assist with these.[17][13] The
                player is able to create a Viking mercenary, or Jomsviking, that can be recruited by other players to
                act as a non-playable character within those games; the player gains additional in-game rewards for
                successful missions that their Jomsviking takes part in.[17] As part of the game's first season of DLC
                content, an expanded "River Raids" game-mode was introduced which offers replayable raiding locations in
                new regions of England not reachable in the main map.[18]

                The game also sees the return of player settlements, which have been absent from the series since
                Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag. However, where previous player settlements offered passive gameplay
                bonuses, the settlement in Valhalla takes on a renewed importance. Game director Ashraf Ismail described
                this as being "[because] a lot of what you're doing in the game world is, at the end of the day, going
                to feed into the settlement so that it can grow, it can flourish." Quests start and finish in the
                settlement and the player is able to direct the construction of certain types of buildings, which in
                turn provide benefits for gameplay. To build these structures, the player needs to lead the Vikings on
                raids to collect resources.[19] As with Odyssey, the player is able to explore romance options for
                Eivor, including same-sex relations.[14]

                Though the use of naval transport has returned, naval combat has been dialed back. Eivor's longship acts
                more as a means of travel when performing raids and for escaping after land combat, rather than being
                used in combat with other naval vessels.[13][20] In addition to these, the player can engage in a
                variety of activities such as; hunting, fishing, brawls with other Vikings, drinking contests, and
                flyting challenges, which Ubisoft described as "Viking rap battle[s]",[21] in addition to an original
                dice game called "Orlog" and Cairn construction.
