            <p>Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed by Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch"
                Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first
                made public in May 2009 before being fully released on November 18, 2011, with Notch stepping down and
                Jens "Jeb" Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has become the best-selling video game in
                history, with over 300 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active players as of 2023.
                Over the years following its release, it has been ported to several platforms, including PC, mobile and
                various consoles.

                In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, pixelated, procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with
                virtually infinite terrain. Players can discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and
                build structures, earthworks, and machines. Depending on their chosen game mode, players can fight
                hostile mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes
                include a survival mode (in which players must acquire resources to build in the world and maintain
                health), creative mode (in which players have unlimited resources and the ability to fly), spectator
                mode (in which players can fly, go through blocks, and enter the bodies of other players and entities),
                adventure mode (in which players have to survive without being able to build and place blocks), and
                hardcore mode (in which the difficulty is set to Hard and dying causes the player to lose their ability
                to play on that world). The game's large community also offers a wide variety of user-generated content,
                such as modifications, servers, skins, texture packs, and custom maps, which add new game mechanics and
                possibilities.

                Minecraft has received critical acclaim, winning several awards and being cited by some as one of the
                greatest video games ever created; social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual
                Minecon conventions played prominent roles in popularizing the game. The game has also been used in
                educational environments to teach chemistry, computer-aided design, and computer science. In 2014,
                Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. Several
                spin-offs have also been made, including Minicraft, Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Earth, Minecraft
                Dungeons, and Minecraft Legends. In addition, a live-action film of the same name is scheduled for a
                theatrical release in 2025.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox game that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount
                of freedom in choosing how to play the game.[17] However, there is an achievement system,[18] known as
                "advancements" in the Java Edition of the game, "trophies" on the PlayStation ports, and "achievements"
                in Bedrock Edition and the Xbox ports.[citation needed] Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by
                default, but players have the option of a third-person perspective.[19] The game world is composed of
                rough 3D objects—mainly cubes and fluids, and commonly called "blocks"—representing various materials,
                such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks (known as 'Logs'), water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves
                around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can
                move freely around the world. Players can "mine" blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to
                build things.[20] Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic.[21] The
                game also contains a material called redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices,
                electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems.[22][23]

                The default player skin, Steve, stands on a cliffside overlooking a village in a forest. In the
                distance, there is a small mountain range. The sun is setting to the right, making the sky turn pink and
                blue.
                An example of Minecraft's procedurally generated terrain, including a village and the default skin Steve
                The game world is virtually infinite[j] and procedurally generated as players explore it, using a map
                seed that is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation (or manually specified by the
                player).[24][25][26] There are limits on vertical movement, but Minecraft allows an infinitely large
                game world to be generated on the horizontal plane. Due to technical issues when extremely distant
                locations are reached, however, there is a barrier preventing players from traversing to locations
                beyond 30 million blocks from the center.[k][obsolete source] The game achieves this by splitting the
                world data into smaller 16 by 16 sections called "chunks" that are only created or loaded when players
                are nearby.[24] The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields;[27][28]
                the terrain includes plains, mountains, forests, caves, and bodies of water or lava.[26] The in-game
                time system follows a day and night cycle, with one full cycle lasting for 20 real-time minutes.
