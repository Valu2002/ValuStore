            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>On the night of September 30, 1998[11] two months after the events of Resident Evil, rookie police
                officer Leon S. Kennedy makes his way toward Raccoon City to start his first shift at the Raccoon City
                Police Department. At a gas station on the city outskirts, he meets Claire Redfield, who is looking for
                her brother, Chris Redfield. The gas station is suddenly overrun by zombies, as well as the rest of
                Raccoon City, after a strain of the T-virus contaminated the city's water supply.[12] The two reach the
                police station but are forced to separate when a truck crashes and explodes, and later discover the
                station to be swarming with zombies. The player character finds an infected Lieutenant Marvin Branagh,
                who reveals a secret passage leading out of the station before later succumbing to his bite. While
                exploring the police station, the player character may also be pursued by the Tyrant, a humanoid
                bioweapon created and programmed by the Umbrella Corporation to eliminate everyone within the station.
                The player character[b] eventually reaches the underground passage, where they are attacked by a mutated
                William Birkin, Umbrella's leading scientist, whom they fight off before escaping.

                In the parking garage, Leon is attacked by zombie dogs, but is saved by Ada Wong. Ada claims to be an
                FBI agent sent to retrieve an incriminating sample of the G-virus, the virus responsible for Birkin's
                mutation, which he developed with his wife and coworker Annette.[13] Meanwhile, Claire finds paperwork
                revealing her brother had left Raccoon City weeks prior to investigate Umbrella overseas. She runs into
                a lost Sherry Birkin, the young daughter of William and Annette, and resolves to protect her.

                After investigating Umbrella, news reporter Ben Bertolucci is detained in a holding cell by the corrupt
                police chief and serial killer Brian Irons, who has been covering up Umbrella's activities. As Ben tries
                to convince Leon to release him, the Tyrant suddenly attacks them, killing the former. Leon and Ada flee
                and reach Robert Kendo's gun shop, where they find Robert and his infected daughter Emma. Witnessing
                Robert put down his daughter before committing suicide, Leon decides to help Ada retrieve the G-virus
                sample to expose Umbrella's corruption. The two encounter Annette in the sewers, who shoots Leon in the
                back before escaping to Umbrella's underground lab, NEST, unwilling to give up the G-virus sample.[14]
                Leon recovers; he and Ada kiss as they descend into NEST.

                Meanwhile, Sherry is abducted and taken to the Raccoon City Orphanage by Irons.[15] William arrives and
                injects Irons with a "G-embryo", which bursts from Irons' stomach, killing him. He incapacitates Claire
                and deliberately infects Sherry, confident that her body will accept the G-virus and allow it to
                replicate.[16]

                Finding Sherry and descending underground into NEST, Claire retrieves a vaccine for the G-virus, which
                Annette administers to her daughter. Meanwhile, Leon retrieves the G-virus sample and runs into Annette
                again, who outs Ada as a mercenary intending to sell the sample to the highest bidder. William kills
                Annette; Ada demands the sample from Leon at gunpoint, but is knocked off into the abyss below NEST,
                along with the sample, as the facility starts to self-destruct.[17] Leon then defeats the mutated and
                deadlier "Super Tyrant" after Ada, having survived her fall, throws him a rocket launcher before
                departing. He, Claire, and Sherry escape on a train out of the facility, where they are attacked by
                William once more in his final mutated form. Fortunately, the train decouples and William is destroyed
                in the lab's destruction. As the three reach safety, Leon and Claire vow to continue their fight against
                Umbrella.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Resident Evil 2 is a survival horror third person shooter game – unlike the remake of the first game,
                which sought to update and improve the original experience, this remake reimagines the gameplay and
                story for modern audiences.[2][3] The game is set in Raccoon City, a fictional mountain city in the
                Midwest that is in the middle of a zombie apocalypse, and allows the player to choose from one of two
                characters, Leon S. Kennedy or Claire Redfield. The protagonist chosen affects the weapons, areas,
                items, subplot, supporting protagonist (Leon has Ada Wong, a mysterious federal agent investigating the
                Umbrella Corporation, and Claire has Sherry Birkin, the young daughter of an Umbrella executive being
                pursued by a monster) and the final boss.</p>
