            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>In 2004,[i] Michael Townley, Trevor Philips, and Brad Snider partake in a failed robbery in Ludendorff,
                North Yankton, resulting in Michael being presumed dead. Nine years later, Michael lives with his family
                in the city of Los Santos under the alias Michael De Santa, having made a secret agreement with the
                Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB)[j] agent Dave Norton to stay hidden. Across town, gangbanger Franklin
                Clinton works for a corrupt car salesman and meets Michael while attempting to fraudulently repossess
                his son's car. The two later become friends. When Michael finds his wife sleeping with her tennis coach,
                he and Franklin chase the coach to a mansion, which Michael heavily damages in anger. The owner of the
                mansion, drug lord Martin Madrazo, demands compensation. Michael returns to a life of crime to obtain
                the money, and enlists Franklin as an accomplice. With the help of Michael's old friend Lester Crest, a
                disabled hacker, they rob a jewellery store to pay off the debt. Meanwhile, Trevor, who lives in squalor
                in rural Blaine County, hears of the heist and realises it was Michael's work; Trevor had believed the
                FIB killed Michael in the Ludendorff heist. Trevor finds Michael and reunites with him, forcing Michael
                to reluctantly accept him back into his life.

                As time goes on, the protagonists' lives spiral out of control. Michael's criminal behaviour prompts his
                family to leave him. When he later becomes a movie producer, he comes into conflict with Devin Weston, a
                billionaire venture capitalist and corporate raider, who attempts to shut down Michael's studio. Michael
                thwarts his efforts and inadvertently kills his lawyer, causing Devin to vow revenge. Meanwhile,
                Franklin must rescue his friend Lamar Davis from their former friend and rival gangbanger Harold
                "Stretch" Joseph, who attempts to kill them to prove himself to his new gang. Concurrently, Trevor tries
                to consolidate his control over various black markets in Blaine County, waging war against The Lost
                outlaw motorcycle club, Latino street gangs, rival meth dealers, the private military company
                Merryweather, and triad kingpin Wei Cheng.

                Having broken his agreement with Dave by committing robberies again, Michael is coerced by Dave and his
                superior, Steve Haines, to perform a series of operations alongside Franklin and Trevor to undermine the
                International Affairs Agency (IAA).[k] Under Steve's direction and with Lester's help, they attack an
                armored car carrying funds for the IAA and steal an experimental nerve agent from an IAA lab. As Steve
                comes under increasing scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin to erase evidence against him from the
                FIB servers. Michael takes the opportunity to wipe the data on his activities, destroying Steve's
                leverage over him.

                After reconciling with his family, Michael starts planning his final heist with Trevor, Franklin, and
                Lester: raiding the Union Depository's gold bullion reserve. However, Trevor discovers that Brad was not
                imprisoned as he was led to believe, but killed during the Ludendorff heist and buried in the grave
                marked for Michael. Deducing that the heist was a setup and that he was supposed to be killed in Brad's
                place, Trevor feels betrayed and leaves Michael for dead following a shootout with Cheng's henchmen.
                Although Franklin rescues Michael, Trevor's anger towards the latter causes friction within the group
                and threatens to undermine their plans. Meanwhile, Steve attempts to arrest Michael and Dave, and they
                become caught in a Mexican standoff between the FIB, the IAA, and Merryweather. Steve escapes while
                Michael and Dave are rescued by Trevor, who believes only he has the right to kill Michael.

                The Union Depository heist is successful, but Franklin is afterwards approached by Steve and Dave, who
                contend that Trevor is a liability, and Devin, who seeks revenge on Michael. Franklin has three options:
                kill Trevor, kill Michael, or attempt to save both in a suicide mission. Should Franklin choose to kill
                either Michael or Trevor, his relationship with the other ceases or becomes strained, and he returns to
                his old life.[31][32] Otherwise, the trio, aided by Lamar and Lester, withstand an onslaught from the
                FIB and Merryweather before going on to kill Cheng, Stretch, Steve, and Devin. Michael and Trevor
                reconcile, and the three protagonists cease working together but remain friends.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure game[2] played from either a third-person[3] or first-person
                perspective.[b] Players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the
                story.[5] Outside of the missions, players may freely roam the open world. Composed of the San Andreas
                open countryside area, and its fictional Blaine County and city of Los Santos, the world is much larger
                in area than earlier entries in the series.[6][c] It may be fully explored after the game's beginning
                without restriction, although story progress unlocks more gameplay content.[8]
                In the single-player mode, players control three characters: Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips and
                Franklin Clinton—criminals whose stories interconnect as they complete missions. Some missions are
                completed with only one character and others feature two or three.[18] Outside the missions, players may
                switch between characters at will by a directional compass on the HUD, although this feature is
                restricted at certain points during the story. During missions, characters may automatically switch to
                complete specific objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if he is in danger and needs
                help, and flash white if he has a strategic advantage.[19] Though players complete missions with the
                protagonists, the more difficult heist missions require aid from AI-controlled accomplices with unique
                skill sets like computer hacking and driving. If an accomplice survives a successful heist, they take a
                cut from the cash reward[20] and may be available for later missions with improvements to their unique
                skills.[21] Some heists afford multiple strategies; in a holdup mission, players may either stealthily
                subdue civilians with an incapacitating agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn.[22]

                Each character has a set of eight skills that represent their ability in specific areas such as shooting
                and driving. Though skills improve through play, each character has a skill with expertise by default
                (e.g. Trevor's flying skill).[23] The eighth "special" skill determines proficiency in an ability that
                is unique to each respective character. Michael enters bullet time in combat, Franklin slows down time
                while driving, and Trevor deals twice as much damage to enemies while taking half as much in combat.[24]
                A meter on each character's HUD depletes when an ability is being used and regenerates when players
                perform skilful actions (for example, drifting in vehicles as Franklin or performing headshots as
                Michael).
