            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Far Cry 6 takes place in 2021 in Yara, a fictional Caribbean island nation inspired by Cuba and ruled by
                the dictator Antón Castillo (Giancarlo Esposito).[15][16][17] In 1967 a guerrilla revolution topples the
                presidency of Antón's father, leading to Yara's isolation from the rest of the world. Following the
                nation's collapse, Antón becomes a political prisoner. In 2019,[18][19] Antón is elected president and
                oversees the creation of Viviro, a new cancer treatment developed from Yara's tobacco, promising it will
                stabilize the nation's economy. Two years later, Antón announces a draft "lottery" to conscript citizens
                as farmers in the tobacco fields. Antón has a 13-year-old son, Diego (Anthony Gonzalez), whom he grooms
                to be his successor.

                In the capital Esperanza, as Yara's armed forces round up citizens for the draft, Dani Rojas prepares to
                escape to Miami in the United States via fishing boat, alongside friends Lita Torres and Alejo Ruiz.
                Alejo is shot and killed after provoking troops in the street, while Dani and Lita flee to the awaiting
                boat filled with other refugees and escape. However, Antón stops the boat and reveals that Diego was
                attempting to flee with them. After retrieving Diego, he orders the boat sunk by gunfire. Dani survives
                the commotion and wakes up with a mortally wounded Lita on an island's beach, far away from Esperanza.
                As Lita dies, she urges Dani to look for the nearby Clara Garcia, leader of the guerilla movement
                Libertad. Upon arrival, Clara tells Dani to invite ex-spymaster and weapon maker Juan Cortez back into
                Libertad, disrupt the Fuerzas Nacionales de Defensa (FND) forces on the island, and clear the blockade
                trapping the guerrillas in the region. Once Dani fulfills all the tasks, Clara gives Dani a boat to flee
                Yara. If Dani does not leave, Clara gives the order to aid anti-Castillo forces throughout Yara's three
                major regions—Madrugada, Valle de Oro, and El Este—and convince them to help Libertad oust Antón.

                In Madrugada, Dani searches for the revered Montero family, who are allied with the region's guerrillas
                and tobacco workers. They take down General José Castillo—Antón's nephew, commander of Yara's air force,
                and a slave driver who robbed the Monteros and other local farmers of their lands to grow the Viviro
                tobacco. Over in Valle de Oro, Dani assists the rap band Máximas Matanzas in airing TV and radio
                performances to push back against pro-Castillo propaganda spread by María Marquessa, Yara's Minister of
                Culture and Diego's mother. Upon killing María during a televised interview about Viviro, they encounter
                Dr. Edgar Reyes, the scientist behind Viviro's conception; it is revealed that he performed cruel
                experiments on disenfranchised tobacco workers in concentration camps as part of his effort to create
                the drug. With this in mind, Dani goes to one of his research facilities and kills him. Meanwhile in El
                Este, a man known as "El Tigre" awaits Dani's arrival on top of a mountain hideout housing the Legends
                of ‘67, the veteran revolutionaries who overthrew Antón's father. While he is willing to help Libertad,
                the others are not, so Dani shows them photos of poor working conditions in tobacco farms to convince
                them to join. While attempting this, Dani comes across an anarchist rebel group of university students
                known as La Moral who are fighting against Yara's naval commander Admiral Benítez. The two groups unite
                and storm Benítez's fort to kill her, ending her iron-fisted rule on Yara's seas. They then track down
                Sean McKay, a Canadian business magnate who handles Viviro exports and imports, and either kill him or
                make a deal with him to finance Libertad.

                After uniting the anti-Castillo forces under Libertad, Dani learns that Antón is holding Clara at his
                private island's villa, under the pretense of a parley. When Dani confronts him, he and Diego reveal
                that Antón has been suffering from leukemia for 13 years, and the Viviro treatment stopped working 6
                months earlier. Impressed by Dani's feats, and wishing that Diego has a protector for when he dies,
                Antón demands that Dani become his general in exchange for Clara's life. Juan attempts to assassinate
                Antón but opts to shoot Diego instead, though Dani knocks him out of the way. In response to the
                shooting, Antón kills Clara and escapes with Diego to Esperanza. Backed by the anti-Castillo forces,
                Dani enters Antón's presidential palace alone and confronts him in his office. Dani promises to protect
                Diego, but Antón, believing that Diego would instead be tortured as he had been after his father's
                toppling, shoots him before committing suicide. The resistance forces unite with Dani and witness the
                Castillo corpses. They unanimously declare Dani the new leader of Yara, but Dani refuses the leadership,
                turning it over to them. After burying Clara, Dani and Juan wage war against Castillo's surviving
                loyalists.

                An alternate ending occurs if Dani sails away from Yara before confronting Castillo. Dani will be shown
                three months later relaxing on a beach in Miami, with a news broadcast detailing how Castillo has
                consolidated his hold over Yara by crushing rebel forces and executing Clara.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Similar to the previous entries in the series, Far Cry 6 is a first-person shooter game, set in an open
                world environment navigable on foot or via various land, water, and air vehicles. Players assume the
                role of a local rebel named Dani Rojas, a former conscript in the military turned into a guerrilla
                fighter, whose gender they can select at the start of the game. The world is divided into seven main
                regions with an array of terrain, ranging from urban areas and dense jungles, to mountain ranges and
                open oceans.[2][3][4] Gameplay focuses on armed and close-quarters combat. Players are able to use a
                wide array of conventional weapons (such as sidearms, assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns,
                light-machine guns, sniper rifles and grenade launchers). Firearms can be customized using materials
                found throughout the world.

                In a new addition to the series, the game features several prototypes of special weaponry, called
                "Resolver weapons", each offering a certain perk to the player's loadout, for example a silent
                close-range nailgun or a sling-shot projectile weapon which fires CDs.[5][6] Another new addition is the
                "Supremo" backpacks, allowing augmentation of the playstyle by assigning more perks to the player's
                loadout, such as firing homing missiles or seeing enemies through solid objects.[7] Unlike the previous
                titles in the series, players are able to holster weapons; as a result, enemy NPCs will not attack the
                player on sight, unless within restricted areas.[8]

                The game introduces a "Rank Level" system which indicates the player's rank and highlights the level of
                a specific region. As the game progresses and the player explores more of the world, enemy forces will
                be equipped with more powerful gear and target locations become more heavily fortified.[9][10] Like
                previous games in the series, outposts are scattered throughout the world, allowing the player to kill
                or neutralize the enemy presence to reduce the dominance of forces in a particular area.[11] The game
                also implements a new notoriety and reputation-style gameplay mechanic. If a high notoriety level is
                earned, as a result of actions taken against enemy NPCs for example, the player will be hunted by
                special forces. The notoriety meter can be reduced by fleeing combat and staying hidden for a specific
                period of time.[12]

                The player has the ability to construct and upgrade guerrilla bases called "Camp Facilities", which
                provide useful resources and in-game bonuses to increase the skillset of the character, specialize perks
                in hunting animals, unlock fast travel locations throughout Yara, enlist new recruits and manage their
                equipment, or launch friendly NPC operations.[13] The game's version of Far Cry 5's "Fangs for Hire"
                companion system returns, called "Amigos", which features recruitable animals with a variety of
                abilities and perks tasked to assist the player in combat and exploration.
