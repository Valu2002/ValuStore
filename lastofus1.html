            <p>The Last of Us Part I is a 2022 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony
                Interactive Entertainment. A remake of the 2013 game The Last of Us, it features revised gameplay,
                including enhanced combat and exploration, and expanded accessibility options. Players control Joel, who
                is tasked with escorting the young Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States and defend her against
                cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus. The game includes a remake
                of the 2014 expansion pack The Last of Us: Left Behind, which follows Ellie and her best friend Riley.
                The original game's online multiplayer mode is omitted.

                Development was led by game director Matthew Gallant and creative director Shaun Escayg, who replaced
                original directors Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann. Part I was rebuilt to take advantage of updated
                hardware, requiring new animations, art direction, and character models to align with the vision of the
                original development team. The visual departments analyzed the original cutscenes and narrative beats to
                identify crucial storylines and their original direction and purpose. The team expanded upon the
                gameplay, technology, and accessibility features of The Last of Us Part II (2020), using its game engine
                and building upon it with the updated technology. The cutscenes feature audio descriptions, for which
                the developers collaborated with Descriptive Video Works. Part I supports 3D audio, as well as the
                haptic feedback and adaptive triggers of the DualSense controller.

                Following several leaks, The Last of Us Part I was announced in June 2022 and released for PlayStation 5
                in September. It received positive reviews, with praise for its graphical enhancements, facial
                animations, artificial intelligence, and its added accessibility, audio, and controller options. The
                response to its gameplay and level design was mixed, and several critics questioned the necessity of a
                remake, especially considering its price. It received an award at the Visual Effects Society Awards, and
                nominations at the Game Awards and Golden Joystick Awards. The Windows release in March 2023 was marred
                by performance problems and received mixed reviews.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>The Last of Us Part I is a remake of the 2013 video game The Last of Us, an action-adventure game played
                from a third-person perspective.[13] The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments to advance the
                story, and uses firearms, improvised weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and stealth to defend against hostile
                humans and cannibalistic creatures known as the Infected, who have been infected by a mutated strain of
                the Cordyceps fungus.[14][15]

                For most of the game, player character Joel escorts a young girl, Ellie, across the United States.[16]
                The player controls Ellie throughout the winter segment,[15] and briefly controls Joel's daughter Sarah
                in the opening sequence.[17] In the included expansion The Last of Us: Left Behind, the player controls
                Ellie as she spends time with her best friend and love interest Riley Abel.[14][18] The original game's
                online multiplayer mode is omitted from Part I,[19] and its narrative is entirely unchanged.[20]

                The remake features revised gameplay, including enhanced combat and exploration.[11][12] The overhauled
                artificial intelligence (AI) allows more non-player characters (NPCs) on screen,[6] with enemy AI acting
                more aggressive and tactical than in the original game.[15] The Infected received gameplay adaptations,
                such as new Stalker animations and a charge move for Bloaters.[21] Gameplay additions include a
                permadeath mode, a speedrun-focused mode, and new costumes for Joel and Ellie.[22] The expanded
                accessibility options include customizable controls, audio description for cutscenes, and haptic
                feedback during dialogue;[23] difficulty modes can be customized to change enemy resilience, stealth
                efficacy, and resource availability.[20] The overhauled photo mode adds several features, allowing
                visual and gameplay modifiers such as slow motion and infinite ammunition.[20]

                On PlayStation 5, the game supports hardware features such as 3D audio,[11][12] and uses the haptic
                feedback and adaptive triggers of the DualSense controller to emulate gameplay actions such as shooting
                a shotgun or drawing a bowstring.[24] It can display at native 4K resolution at 30 frames per second, or
                upscaled resolution at a targeted 60 frames per second; with variable refresh rate enabled, both modes
                allow an unlocked frame rate, capable of more than 60 frames per second.
