            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Several years before the events of the first game, Nate and Sam hunt for Avery's treasure. Alongside
                Rafe, the Drake brothers infiltrate a Panamanian jail to access the former cell of Avery's first mate,
                where Nate discovers a hollow St. Dismas idol. When the prison warden who aided them demands a cut, Rafe
                impulsively kills him, triggering a frantic escape. Nate and Rafe successfully escape, but Sam is shot
                by guards and presumed dead.

                Fifteen years later, following the events of the previous game, Nate has retired in New Orleans with
                Elena but misses the excitement of his old life. He is visited by Sam, who survived the gunshots and has
                spent the intervening time incarcerated. He explains that he escaped with drug lord Hector Alcazar, who
                demands that Sam find Avery's treasure or be killed. Nate agrees to help Sam, lying to Elena that he has
                accepted a salvaging job. Aided by Sully, the Drakes steal a duplicate Dismas idol from an illegal
                auction in Italy, bringing them into conflict with Nadine and her employer, Rafe, who is still searching
                for Avery's treasure. A map inside the idol leads the Drakes to St. Dismas's cathedral in the Scottish
                Highlands, where they discover a hidden temple and a map highlighting King's Bay in Madagascar.

                In King's Bay, the Drakes and Sully learn that Avery, Thomas Tew, and ten other pirate captains pooled
                their treasures. Nate uncovers a map to Libertalia, a fabled pirate utopia. The group return to their
                hotel to find Elena. Upset at Nate's deception and the appearance of Sam, whom Nate had never mentioned,
                Elena leaves. Nate sends Sully after her. The Drakes follow the map to an island and discover
                Libertalia. They find evidence of a civil war; the founders stole the city's treasure and moved it
                across the island to New Devon, an extravagant and well-fortified town built for them. The brothers are
                cornered by Rafe, who reveals that he released Sam from jail two years ago and that Sam lied; Alcazar
                died six months ago and Sam had actually double-crossed Rafe to resume searching with Nate. Rafe
                prepares to shoot Nate; Sam shields him, but Nate is knocked off a cliff.

                Elena rescues Nate, who reveals his past: as teenagers, he and Sam discovered that their mother, a
                historian named Cassandra Morgan, was researching Libertalia. The boys, after breaking into the house of
                the person associated with their mother and nearly being caught by police, decided to start new lives by
                changing their surname to Drake to honor their mother's theory about Francis Drake's descendants. In New
                Devon, Nate and Elena learn that Libertalia descended into conflict over the treasure, with the founders
                killing all the colonists. In-fighting between the founders began, until they were all poisoned by Avery
                and Tew.

                The group rescue Sam and convinces him to escape with them, but he soon decides to pursue the treasure.
                Following Sam's trail, Nate finds Avery's treasure-laden ship in a cavern. Having collected a large
                amount of treasure, Nadine refuses to risk more of Avery's traps, but Rafe coerces her by bribing her
                men. Aboard the ship, Sam triggers a trap, starting a fire and pinning him beneath rubble. Nate
                confronts Rafe and Nadine in the ship hold, where the skeletons of Avery and Tew lie, having killed each
                other over the treasure. Nadine leaves Rafe with Nate and Sam to die. Enraged, Rafe challenges Nate to a
                sword fight. Nate cuts a rope attached to a bundle of treasure, causing it to fall on Rafe and crushing
                him to death, and rescues Sam. The pair return to Sully's plane and the group escapes.

                Sam and Sully team up for a new job while Nate and Elena return home. Elena explains that Sam pocketed
                some of the gold and gave it to her. Realizing they both need adventure in their lives, she buys the
                salvage company for which Nate worked, installing Nate as the owner, and plans to revive her old
                exploration show. Years later, Nate and Elena have become successful salvagers and archaeologists. After
                their teenage daughter Cassie (Kaitlyn Dever) discovers relics from their adventures, Nate decides to
                tell her their story.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective, with
                platforming elements. Players traverse several environments, moving through locations including towns,
                buildings, and wilderness to advance through the game's story. Players use firearms, melee combat, and
                stealth to combat hostile enemies. For most of the game, players control Nathan Drakeâa treasure hunter
                who is physically adept and can jump, sprint, climb, swim, scale narrow ledges and walls, swing with a
                rope, use a grappling hook and perform other acrobatic actions.[2] Players also drive vehicles during
                some gameplay segments. In combat, players can use long-ranged weapons, such as rifles and shotguns, and
                short-barreled guns such as pistols and revolvers; handheld explosives such as grenades and dynamite are
                also available.[4] The game's melee combat system was also reworked to avoid the presence of quick time
                events.[5] The grappling hook allows players to leap over gaps, often giving them a tactical advantage
                in combat.[6] Though players can attack enemies directly, they have the option to use stealth tactics to
                attack undetected or sneak by them.[7] While the game is linear, environments feature multiple paths for
                players to explore;[8] maps are significantly larger than earlier entries in the series.[9][c]

                The game features an artificial intelligence system in which hostile enemies react to any combat
                situation they are placed in; they respond to players' actions, coordinate tactics, and cooperate with
                each other.[5] Players' companions are also controlled by artificial intelligence.[11] The game
                introduces a dialogue tree, allowing players to decide the outcome of some conversations, though it does
                not affect the story's progression.[12] Extra visual filters and modes, such as a zero-gravity mode,
                bullet time gameplay, and a cel-shaded art style, can be unlocked by using points players collected in
                the main game.
