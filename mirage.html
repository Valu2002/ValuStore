            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Following the events of Assassin's Creed Valhalla: The Last Chapter, the modern-day Assassins use a blood
                sample provided by Basim Ibn Ishaq to relive his memories during the age of the Abbasid Caliphate.

                In 861 CE, Basim is a young street thief living in Anbar with his childhood friend and companion, Nehal.
                For his entire life, Basim has been haunted by visions of a monstrous jinni, which Nehal had been
                helping him cope with. While just a simple thief, Basim has greater aspirations and attempts to join the
                Hidden Ones, but is flatly rejected by the senior Hidden One stationed in Anbar, Roshan bint-La'Ahad. In
                an effort to prove himself, Basim sneaks into the Caliph's palace to steal a chest sought by both the
                Hidden Ones and the Order of the Ancients. Basim retrieves a disk-shaped artifact from the chest, which
                displays a holographic message, before he is confronted by the Caliph, al-Mutawakkil. Nehal kills the
                Caliph to save Basim and they both flee the palace.

                In retaliation for the Caliph's murder, the guards begin slaughtering all thieves in Anbar, including
                many of Basim's friends, and he angrily blames Nehal before parting ways. Now on the run, Basim manages
                to escape the city with Roshan's help, and she takes him to the Hidden Ones' mountain fortress at
                Alamut. Over the next few years, Basim trains under Roshan and is eventually initiated into the Hidden
                Ones. When their Mentor, Rayhan, learns of the Order's rapidly expanding influence in Baghdad, he
                decides to send a contingent of Hidden Ones to the city to investigate, led by Basim and Roshan.

                Upon arriving in Baghdad, Basim learns that five Order members have infiltrated the Caliphate's highest
                levels of power, and are exploiting it in order to excavate or rebuild ancient Isu artifacts. He
                proceeds to hunt down four of the Order members, assassinating them and their subordinates and foiling
                their respective plots.

                During this time, Basim reunites with Nehal, who is distrustful of the Hidden Ones and encourages Basim
                to investigate the artifacts the Order is looking for, believing they are both somehow linked to them.
                Eventually, Basim confronts the Order's leader, Qabiha, al-Mutawakkil's former concubine, who claims
                that the answers he seeks lie in an Isu temple underneath Alamut. Qabiha then tries to convince Basim to
                accompany her to the temple, but is killed by Roshan, who warns Basim not to investigate any further.

                Disobeying Roshan, Basim travels to Alamut with Nehal, only to find the fortress under siege by the
                Order's forces. Basim rescues many captured Hidden Ones and rallies them to fight off the attack while
                he heads to the temple after convincing Rayhan that the power held within could be used to defeat the
                Order for good. However, he is confronted by Roshan, who reveals that she is aware of Basim's true
                nature and attempts to stop him from entering the temple, fearing what it may awaken within Basim. Basim
                defeats Roshan, but spares her life and enters the temple with Nehal. Inside, he finds more disk-shaped
                artifacts[c] and discovers that the temple used to be a prison where the Isu Loki was held in at some
                point before escaping. Basim also realizes that Nehal never existed; both she and the jinni were in fact
                representations of his repressed memories as Loki. Deciding to embrace his nature as Loki's
                reincarnation, Basim "fuses" with Nehal and regains his memories.

                Upon leaving the temple, Basim is welcomed back into the Hidden Ones, which causes Roshan to resign in
                protest. Now fully aware of his past life as Loki, Basim muses that he has been reborn in a new world,
                and looks forward to a "reunion" with those who were responsible for his imprisonment.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Assassin's Creed Mirage is an action-adventure stealth game intended to be reminiscent of older
                Assassin's Creed titles, being more linear and story-focused and reducing the number of role-playing
                elements present in recent installments of the series. Parkour, close-quarter combat, and stealth are
                core elements of the gameplay. For assassination missions, Mirage adopts the "Black Box" design
                previously seen in Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed Syndicate, where players have to explore
                the environment to find different ways to reach and eliminate their targets.[2]

                The game is set principally in the city of Baghdad, which is divided into four districts—the Round City,
                Karkh, Abassiyah with its House of Wisdom, and Harbiyah—but also features several smaller towns like
                Anbar and Jarjaraya, located on the outskirts of the city.[3] Alamut, the fortress headquarters of the
                Hidden Ones, is also featured in several missions, but is inaccessible outside of the storyline. Baghdad
                is much smaller than the worlds of recent Assassin's Creed titles, being closer in size to Unity's and
                Revelations' depictions of Paris and Constantinople, respectively.[4]

                Similarly to previous Assassin protagonists, the main character, Basim, has a large arsenal of weapons
                and tools at his disposal, including the signature Assassin Hidden Blade, smoke bombs, throwing knives,
                and poison darts. Both weapons and tools can be upgraded through a skill tree which allows different
                effects to be applied to them.[5] Basim also has access to both Eagle Vision and an avian companion
                named Enkidu (after the character from Mesopotamian mythology), an eastern imperial eagle that can be
                used to scout nearby areas.[6] Unlike previous Assassin's Creed games which featured avian companions,
                enemy marksmen can detect and shoot at Enkidu, requiring the player to eliminate the marksmen before
                Enkidu can be used again.[2]

                Mirage introduces a new ability called "Assassin Focus", which allows the player to eliminate multiple
                enemies simultaneously and is recharged by performing stealth assassinations. When the ability is
                activated, time stops and the player can mark up to five enemies who will then be automatically killed
                by Basim in quick succession.[5] Another new feature are various poles located around Baghdad, which can
                be used to cross wide gaps.[7] Furthermore, moving and running animations have been refined to improve
                mobility and fluidity, with the development team taking inspiration from "samurai, ninja, and even Jedi
                to a certain point".
