            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Some time after the events of Into the Nexus, Ratchet and Clank are celebrated as galactic heroes during
                a parade hosted by Captain Quark, Skid McMarx, and Rusty Pete on Corson V. During it, Clank reveals that
                he has repaired the Dimensionator, a device capable of opening rifts to other dimensions so that Ratchet
                can search for the Lombax race and his missing family. However, Doctor Nefarious attacks the parade and
                attempts to steal the Dimensionator. During the struggle, Ratchet unthinkingly shoots the Dimensionator,
                which causes dimensional rifts to begin opening randomly. Ratchet, Clank, and Dr. Nefarious are
                transported to an alternate universe, where the Dimensionator explodes, damaging the fabric of space and
                time and separating the three. Clank awakens to find himself alone and now missing his right arm from
                the blast. He is discovered and picked up by a female Lombax named Rivet. Meanwhile, Dr. Nefarious ends
                up in a throne room, where he is mistaken for Emperor Nefarious, an alternate version of himself who,
                unlike him, has never been defeated and rules over the galaxy. Ratchet, elsewhere, finds himself alone
                and starts his search for Clank. With the emperor currently absent on a conquest, Dr. Nefarious secretly
                assumes his identity and sends his new minions after Ratchet and Rivet.

                While searching, Ratchet witnesses Rivet escaping the planet with Clank. Ratchet encounters Phantom (the
                alternate Skidd), a member of the Resistance opposed to Emperor Nefarious, which Rivet is a part of, who
                gifts him an electronic helper named Glitch to help him get a ship to follow her. Rivet takes Clank to
                her hideout on Sargasso to interrogate him, not believing his words about the dimensional rifts due to
                her distrust in robots. They discover a dimensional anomaly on the planet which Clank investigates,
                making contact with a prophet named Gary, who enlists his help in repairing other dimensional anomalies
                to prevent the Dimensional Cataclysm. Rivet learns the truth by looking into Clank's memories and
                repairs Clank's communicator so they are able to get in contact with Ratchet and come up with a plan to
                rebuild the Dimensionator so they can return to their own home dimension and stop the Dimensional
                Cataclysm.

                Ratchet heads out to find the blueprint for the Dimensionator, and recruits one of Gary's robot
                apprentices, Kit, to be his partner. Kit warns Ratchet that she is a Warbot built by Emperor Nefarious
                and worries she might lose control of her programming and attack him, but Ratchet reassures her that
                they make a good team. They then head to a secret lab on Cordelion to forge a new Dimensionator, while
                Rivet and Clank head out to Blizar Prime to gather the Phase Quartz needed to power it. After it is
                accidentally destroyed, the two search for the mythical Fixer on Torren IV who can repair anything and
                convince him to overcome his own self-doubt to repair the Phase Quartz. Ratchet and Rivet then finally
                meet in the Scarstu Debris Field, with Clank reuniting with Ratchet and Kit agreeing to become Rivet's
                partner. They complete the Dimensionator, only for Dr. Nefarious to arrive and steal it. Dr. Nefarious
                is defeated in battle, but the real Emperor Nefarious arrives, easily defeating Ratchet and Rivet and
                stealing the Dimensionator for himself, which he plans to use to eliminate Captain Quantum (the
                alternate Captain Qwark) and destroy the Resistance once and for all.

                Rivet pursues Emperor Nefarious, but he uses the Dimensionator to banish her to a pocket dimension. As
                Rivet searches for a rift to escape through, she tells Kit about how she lost her arm to a Warbot
                attack, with Kit realizing she was the one responsible. Meanwhile Ratchet heads out to Ardolis to try
                and warn Captain Quantum, but fails to stop Emperor Nefarious from banishing Captain Quantum through a
                rift. Emperor Nefarious celebrates finally conquering the universe but doesn't feel fulfilled until he
                realizes he can use the Dimensionator to conquer every dimension. Spying on Emperor Nefarious using a
                device that Quantum bugged on him, Ratchet and Rivet realize Emperor Nefarious will need the Dimensional
                Map and head out to intercept him. Rivet and Kit board Emperor Nefarious' flagship and rescue Gary, who
                reveals he hid the Dimensional Map inside a dimensional anomaly. Ratchet and Clank recover the
                Dimensional Map but are ambushed by Emperor Nefarious and banished through a rift. Kit transforms into
                her Warbot form to try and stop Emperor Nefarious, shocking Rivet, but Kit ends up being banished
                through a rift as well.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>The game shares many gameplay similarities with Ratchet & Clank (2016) and other entries in the series.
                It retains elements of previous Ratchet & Clank games, such as strafing, gunplay, collection of bolts,
                automatic weapon and health upgrades, manual Raritanium weapon upgrading and gadgets. The main playable
                character is Ratchet. He is accompanied by his robotic friend and sidekick Clank, who is hung on his
                back. Additionally, the game has a playable female Lombax named Rivet, as well as a robot similar to
                Clank, Kit.[4][6] The player navigates Ratchet and Rivet through diverse environments across a multitude
                of levels, defeating enemies with an array of varied weapons and gadgets, and traversing obstacles to
                complete key mission objectives.[7]

                The game introduces to the series the concept of real-time near instantaneous travel between different
                areas, planets and other worlds within gameplay scenes via a system of inter-dimensional portals.[8] In
                order for the player to utilize this feature, a new mechanic dubbed the "Rift Tether" is introduced in
                Ratchet and Rivet's arsenal that pulls them from one side of a portal to another, allowing them to move
                quickly between points.[8] The game features the return of planets explored in previous entries with a
                dimensional twist, through their alternate counterparts, alongside new planets not seen previously in
                the franchise.[9] The game features enhanced mobility and traversal options with the addition of moves
                such as dashing and wall running.[10] In addition, the game's arsenal features a mix of brand new
                weapons and returning classics from prior installments.[11]

                The game features an assortment of accessibility options, including a high contrast mode and toggles for
                simplified traversal, camera sensitivity, flight assistance, etc., to ensure that all players can enjoy
                the gameplay and complete the story.
