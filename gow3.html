            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Kratos, Gaia, and the other Titans ascend Mount Olympus to destroy the Olympian gods.[N 1] Poseidon
                launches an assault against them, but is killed by Kratos, causing the oceans to flood Greece. Reaching
                Olympus' peak, they attempt to attack Zeus, but he knocks them off the mountain with his lightning bolt.
                As Gaia clings to the mountainside, she refuses to save Kratos, deeming him a pawn for the Titans'
                revenge.

                Kratos falls into the River Styx, where he loses the Blade of Olympus before the souls of the Underworld
                weaken him and ruin the Blades of Athena. Climbing from the river, he is greeted by Athena's spirit, who
                ascended to a higher existence after sacrificing herself to save Zeus from Kratos,[N 2] and had
                witnessed truths which she previously could not see. She gives Kratos the Blades of Exile and tells him
                he must extinguish the Flame of Olympus to kill Zeus. After finding the three Judges of the Underworld
                and the Chain of Balance, Kratos briefly meets the spirit of Pandora, whom he initially mistakes for his
                dead daughter, Calliope. Following an encounter with the Olympian blacksmith Hephaestus and recovering
                the Blade of Olympus, he kills Hades[N 3] and releases the souls of the Underworld. Kratos considers
                searching for Calliope's soul, but Athena reminds him of his quest, and he leaves the Underworld. Kratos
                reaches Olympia and finds Gaia pleading for help, only for Kratos to sever her arm as payback for her
                earlier betrayal, causing her to fall to her apparent death.</p>
        </details>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Kratos' main weapon is the Blades of Exile, replacing the Blades of Athena used in previous installments
                and the opening moments of the game. The weapon is a pair of blades attached to chains wrapped around
                Kratos' wrists and forearms that can be swung in a number of maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires
                new weapons—the Claws of Hades, the Nemean Cestus, and the Nemesis Whip—with other combat options. The
                Nemean Cestus, a pair of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, similar to the Blades of Exile, are required
                to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects
                composed of onyx.[4]

                Unlike in previous games, magical abilities are learned with the acquisition of a new weapon, giving
                each weapon its own magic attack; for example, the Army of Sparta may only be used with the Blades of
                Exile. Magic gives Kratos a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies, such as the Claws of Hades' Soul
                Summon ability, which conjures souls to attack enemies. Other magic includes the Nemean Cestus' Nemean
                Roar and the Nemesis Whip's Nemesis Rage. In addition to four primary weapons, three secondary ones,
                known as Items, are acquired:[4] the Bow of Apollo, the Head of Helios, and the Boots of Hermes. All
                three are required to advance in certain stages of the game; for example, the Head of Helios can be used
                as a lantern in dark areas and to reveal hidden doorways.[6]

                The relics Poseidon's Trident, the Golden Fleece, and Icarus' Wings acquired in previous games are
                retained and used to overcome environmental obstacles, with the Golden Fleece used to deflect enemy
                attacks. Hades' Soul allows Kratos to swim in the River Styx. The Blade of Olympus, a primary weapon in
                God of War II, is used in this game with the special ability Rage of Sparta for temporary
                invulnerability and increased attack damage.[4]

                New additions to the gameplay include the combat grapple, a ranged-grab maneuver which, depending on the
                weapon, can pull Kratos towards foes or force them away—necessary at certain points in the game, with
                Kratos riding harpies across chasms—and a simple grab allowing him to use a weak foe as a battering ram.
                Kratos can now rapidly switch among the four primary weapons in battle, continuing the same attack
                combination. Other extra features include the addition of ten Godly Possessions, often hidden near
                defeated foes and providing additional abilities like unlimited magic during bonus play.[5] The
                challenge mode in this game is called the Challenge of Olympus (seven trials) and is unlocked after the
                game's completion. This mode requires players to complete a series of specific tasks—for example,
                killing all enemies without weapons in a limited amount of time. The player may unlock additional
                rewards, such as bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and concept art of the characters
                and environments, by completing the game's difficulty levels and challenge mode. A new mode, the Combat
                Arena, allows players to set difficulty levels and choose opponents to hone playing skills.
