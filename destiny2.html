            <p>Destiny 2[b] is a free-to-play online first-person shooter video game developed by Bungie. It was
                originally released as a pay to play game in 2017 for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Windows. It became
                free-to-play, utilizing the games as a service model, under the New Light title on October 1, 2019,
                followed by the game's release on Stadia the following month, and then PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S
                platforms in December 2020. The game was published by Activision until December 31, 2018, when Bungie
                acquired the publishing rights to the franchise. It is the sequel to 2014's Destiny and its subsequent
                expansions.

                Set in a "mythic science fiction" world, the game features a multiplayer "shared-world" environment with
                elements of role-playing games. Like the original, activities in Destiny 2 are divided among player
                versus environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types. In addition to normal story
                missions, PvE features three-player "strikes" and dungeons and six-player raids. A free roam patrol mode
                is also available for each destination which feature public events as well as activities not available
                in the original. These activities have an emphasis on exploration of the destinations and interactions
                with non-player characters (NPCs); the original Destiny only featured NPCs in social spaces. PvP
                features objective-based modes, as well as traditional deathmatch game modes.

                Players assume the role of a Guardian, protectors of Earth's last safe city as they wield a power called
                Light to protect humanity from different alien races and combat the looming threat of the Darkness. Like
                the original Destiny, the game features expansion packs which further the story and adds new content
                across the game. Year One of Destiny 2 featured two small expansions, Curse of Osiris (December 2017)
                and Warmind (May 2018). A third, large expansion, Forsaken (September 2018), began Year Two with an
                overhaul on gameplay and also introduced a seasonal model for the game in which smaller content packs
                were released throughout the year between the expansions, with the year divided into four seasons. The
                release of the next expansion, Shadowkeep (October 2019) began Year Three. Beginning with Shadowkeep,
                each release is considered a standalone release, not requiring players to own previous premium content.
                Released alongside this fourth expansion was a version of Destiny 2 called New Light, a free-to-play
                re-release of Destiny 2, which also included access to the first two expansions. Separate seasonal
                passes also became available for each season's content. While the main Destiny 2 game has since been
                "free-to-play", all other content requires purchasing.

                Year Four saw the biggest overhaul on the game, as nearly half of the game's content from its first
                three years, including the original base campaign as well as Curse of Osiris and Warmind, were removed
                from the game and placed into what Bungie calls the Destiny Content Vault. Alongside this change, Year
                Four began with the fifth expansion, Beyond Light (November 2020), which introduced the power of
                Darkness to the players. Bungie described this expansion as the beginning of a new era for the
                franchise, as it would be followed up by The Witch Queen in February 2022 and Lightfall in February
                2023. A final chapter for Destiny's first saga, the "Light and Darkness" saga, was released in June 2024
                called The Final Shape. Alongside this expansion saw a change to the seasonal model as the traditional
                seasons were replaced by three larger episodes.

                Upon release, Destiny 2 received generally favorable reviews from critics. Praise focused on its
                improvements, particularly with regards to its initial story, as well as its gameplay, visuals,
                exploration focus, multiplayer, and public occasions. Reviews were divided on the recategorization of
                the weapons, the Leviathan raid, and new modes. Destiny 2 was nominated for and won various awards, such
                as at The Game Awards 2017 and Game Critics Awards.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Similar to its predecessor, Destiny 2 is a first-person shooter game that incorporates role-playing and
                massively multiplayer online game (MMO) elements.[1] The original Destiny includes on-the-fly
                matchmaking that allowed players to communicate only with other players with whom they were "matched" by
                the game. To communicate with other players in the game world, players had to use their respective
                console's messaging system, until an in-game text chat was added later on.[1] Destiny 2 features a more
                optimal way of matchmaking called "Guided Games", which allows players to search for clans who may need
                additional players for raids. Like the original, activities in Destiny 2 are divided among player versus
                environment (PvE) and player versus player (PvP) game types.[2]
