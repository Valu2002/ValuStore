            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>In India, treasure hunter Chloe Frazer (Claudia Black) searches for the legendary tusk of Ganesh, the son
                of Hindu god Shiva, who lost the tusk while defending his father's temple. Chloe's father was killed by
                bandits while searching for the tusk. Chloe slips past insurgents and meets up with mercenary Nadine
                Ross (Laura Bailey). They sneak into the office of the insurgents' leader, Asav (Usman Ally) a former
                acquaintance of Nadine, who wants to use the tusk to rally India into a civil war. Chloe and Nadine
                steal a map pointing toward the tusk within the ancient Hoysala Empire and a disc that acts as a key.

                In India's Western Ghats, Chloe and Nadine follow the trail of several towers emblazoned with Hindu
                weapons: Ganesh's trident, Shiva's bow, and the axe of Parashurama, who used the axe to remove the tusk.
                The trail leads them to one of Hoysala's two capitals, Halebidu, whose last emperor left to be conquered
                by the Persians seemingly out of vanity. They realize the emperor left a false trail; the tusk is at the
                older capital, Belur. On the way there, they escape Asav and his men but lose the disc. While spying on
                Asav's forces, Nadine sees her old enemy Samuel Drake (Troy Baker); she realizes he is Asav's expert.
                When she expresses her intention to kill Sam, primarily due to the events that transpired in Libertalia,
                Chloe reveals she was working with him before he was abducted. Feeling angry and betrayed, Nadine
                separates from Chloe, but they make amends.

                At Belur, they navigate several puzzles before being captured by Asav, who has realized that Sam is no
                expert and was misleading them the whole time, forcing Chloe to use the disc to reveal the tusk. In the
                process, she discovers that Ganesh allowed Parashurama to cut off his tusk; as Shiva gave the axe to
                him, Ganesh did not want to shame his father by proving the axe useless. Asav triggers a trap and leaves
                Chloe, Nadine and Sam to drown. Chloe picks the locks on their handcuffs and they escape. Despite
                tensions between Nadine and Sam, the three chase after Asav to take back the tusk. Nadine is enraged to
                find that Asav is working with Shoreline, the mercenary group she used to run and from which she was
                ousted.

                Asav trades the tusk to Orca (Gideon Emery), Nadine's former lieutenant, who now runs Shoreline. Chloe,
                Nadine and Sam take down Orca's helicopter and learn that Asav traded the tusk for a bomb he plans to
                detonate in the capital and trigger a civil war. Orca pulls a gun on Nadine, but Sam saves her, allowing
                her to kill Orca. Commandeering a jeep, the three catch up to the train carrying the bomb. The women
                board the train and fight through Asav's men. Chloe and Sam switch the tracks, redirecting the train
                away from the city. In the engine car, Chloe and Nadine fight Asav, whose leg gets trapped under the
                bomb. They jump to safety before the train falls from a collapsed bridge and explodes, killing Asav.
                Chloe and Nadine decide to partner up, while Sam reacts with horror at their intentions to donate the
                tusk to the Ministry of Culture instead of selling it.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Uncharted: The Lost Legacy is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective, with
                platform game elements and set in the Indian Peninsula. Players control Chloe Frazer—a treasure hunter
                who is physically adept and can jump, sprint, climb, swim, swing, and perform other acrobatic
                actions.[2] Players traverse several environments, moving through locations including towns, buildings,
                and temples to advance through the game's story.[3] Players use firearms, melee combat, and stealth to
                defend against the hostile enemies,[4] and also drive vehicles during some gameplay segments.
                In combat, players can use long-ranged weapons, such as rifles and shotguns, and short-barreled guns
                such as pistols and revolvers; handheld explosives such as grenades and C4 are also available.[4] Though
                players can attack enemies directly, they have the option to use stealth tactics to attack undetected or
                sneak by them; the game introduces silenced weapons. While the game is linear, environments feature
                multiple paths for players to explore; maps are larger than those in Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.[5] The
                game features an artificial intelligence system in which hostile enemies react to any combat situation
                they are placed in; they respond to players' actions, coordinate tactics, and cooperate with each other.
                Players' companions are also controlled by artificial intelligence and can assist in combat by throwing
                objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location of unseen enemies, or using weapons to attack
                enemies.[6] The game features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the
                characters. Players also can decide the outcome of some conversations through a dialogue tree.[7]

                The game gives access to the multiplayer of Uncharted 4, with additional content tied into The Lost
                Legacy.
