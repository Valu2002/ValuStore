            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>In July 2022, Task Force 141, under the command of General Herschel Shepherd, conducts a surgical missile
                strike against Russian-backed Iranian forces, assassinating Iranian General Ghorbrani during an arms
                deal in Al Mazrah. In October, Ghorbrani's lieutenant, Quds Force Major Hassan Zyani, becomes involved
                in funding terrorist activity and seeks revenge on the United States. Hassan’s activities draw the
                attention of Shepherd and CIA Station Chief Kate Laswell, who order Marine Raiders, led by Task Force
                141 operatives Lieutenant Simon "Ghost" Riley and Sergeant John "Soap" MacTavish, to apprehend Hassan in
                Al Mazrah. Ghost and Soap fail to capture Hassan, but discover that he was in possession of an American
                ballistic missile.

                Laswell and Task Force 141 operatives Captain John Price and Sergeant Kyle "Gaz" Garrick pursue one of
                Hassan's couriers in Amsterdam, learning that Hassan has received protection from and has allied with
                the Las Almas Cartel, and is currently in Mexico. After a failed attempt to apprehend him at the
                Mexico–US border, Mexican Special Forces Colonel Alejandro Vargas and his second-in-command Sergeant
                Major Rodolfo Parra, alongside their unit Los Vaqueros, participate in a joint operation with Ghost,
                Soap, and Shadow Company, a PMC under the direct command of Shepherd and led by its CEO, Phillip Graves,
                to capture Hassan. Although successful, they are forced to release him to avoid political fallout with
                Iran, as they lack the definitive evidence needed to arrest him.

                Data hacked from Hassan's phone leads Price, Laswell, and Gaz to Cape Vilan, where they discover that
                Las Almas possessed Russian-made GPS devices for missiles. When Laswell is captured by Urzik terrorist
                group Al-Qatala, Price and Gaz track down and save her in Urzikstan, with the aid of their old allies
                Nikolai and Farah Karim. Meanwhile, Alejandro and Soap manage to capture Las Almas' leader, "El Sin
                Nombre", revealed to be Alejandro's former special forces comrade Valeria Garza. Valeria reveals that
                one of the missiles is on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, prompting a raid led by Task Force 141,
                Shadow Company and Alejandro to prevent its launch. Despite the successful mission, Graves and Shadow
                Company betray Alejandro and Task Force 141 under Shepherd's orders. Graves captures Alejandro and
                seizes Los Vaqueros’ base of operations, while Ghost and Soap flee into Las Almas as Shadow Company
                slaughters its residents in search of Hassan. With help from Rodolfo, Laswell, Price, and Gaz, Ghost and
                Soap free Alejandro and Los Vaqueros.

                Laswell reveals that Shepherd and Graves were responsible for an illegal missile transportation mission
                in August meant to aid American allies in the Middle East. The transport was ambushed by a Russian PMC
                known as the Konni Group, with the three ballistic missiles being stolen, forcing Shepherd to cover up
                the mission's failure. Price confronts Shepherd over the revelations, promising to pursue him when the
                current threat is eliminated. Task Force 141 and Los Vaqueros succeed in retaking the latter's base and
                seemingly killing Graves, while also learning from Valeria that Hassan is in Chicago. The team narrowly
                thwarts Hassan's plan, detonating his missile en route to the Pentagon, and kills him. In the aftermath,
                Shepherd has gone into hiding, while Laswell informs 141 of the new leader of the Russian
                Ultranationalists responsible for Shepherd's botched operation, whom Price identifies as Vladimir
                Makarov.

                In a mid-credits scene, a Russian terrorist cell prepares to hijack a plane. They receive a text from
                Makarov, who tells them not to speak Russian during the hijacking.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Modern Warfare II introduces several design improvements and changes to the series gameplay, such as
                advanced AI systems in the campaign and co-op modes, water physics, swimming mechanics, and an
                overhauled vehicle system. New gameplay features and movement tactics include dive to prone, mantle, and
                ledge hang along with the removal of slide canceling. New vehicle gameplay features include leaning out
                of vehicle windows, mantling onto a vehicle roof, and hijacking.[3][4][5][6][7] The levelling and
                Gunsmith system has been revamped, allowing players to fine-tune specific attachments to suit their
                playstyles. It also offers weapon platforms that branch progression to reduce repetitiveness, as well as
                featuring a firing range for practice.[8][9][10]

                Modern Warfare II's multiplayer component features several new game modes: Knockout, in which two teams
                attempt to capture a package with limited lives; and Prisoner Rescue, in which an attacking team
                attempts to extract a hostage while a defending team prevents them by fortifying defenses around the
                hostage.[11] Third-person game modes were confirmed in September 2022.[12] The cooperative Special Ops
                mode also returns, featuring two-player missions.[13] "Raids", an additional 3-player activity, was
                added to Special Ops post-launch.[14] Additional multiplayer modes were also released as part of
                post-launch seasons, including the 2v2 "Gunfight" mode, which was previously featured in Modern Warfare
                (2019) and Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War (2020).[15]

                Like the previous game, Modern Warfare II features a free-to-play battle royale game mode called Warzone
                2.0, which is introduced with the first seasonal content update for the game on November 16.[16] In
                addition to the traditional battle royale mode, Warzone 2.0 also introduces DMZ, a new extraction game
                mode in which teams of trios battle against each other as well as AI combatants, while attempting to
                complete missions and extract loot from the playable map.[17]
