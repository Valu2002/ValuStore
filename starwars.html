            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Five years after destroying the Jedi Holocron, Jedi Knight Cal Kestis has parted ways with Cere Junda,
                Greez Dritus, and Merrin to continue his battle against the Empire as a resistance fighter working under
                Saw Gerrera. Cal and his team infiltrate the Imperial capital world of Coruscant and steal valuable
                military data from Senator Daho Sejan. After Cal retrieves the data from Sejan, the Ninth Sister, who
                survived her defeat on Kashyyyk, arrives to confront and exact revenge on Cal, slaughtering Sejan and
                most of Cal's team. Cal fights and kills the Ninth Sister before escaping Coruscant with mercenary Bode
                Akuna; Cal is disheartened to learn from the data that despite all his efforts, the Empire has only
                become more powerful, expanding its reach farther through the galaxy.

                With the Stinger Mantis damaged during his escape from Coruscant, Cal decides to seek out Greez, who
                resides on the remote planet of Koboh, to see if he can repair the damages. After surviving a crash
                landing on the planet's surface, Cal finds the local population menaced by a criminal organization known
                as the Bedlam Raiders, led by an armored Gen'dai named Rayvis. Cal reunites with Greez, who directs him
                to a cave containing the parts needed to repair the Mantis.

                While exploring, Cal comes across ZN-A4 or "Zee," a droid that served the Jedi Order during the High
                Republic era. Zee gives Cal a High Republic tuner device and tells him she was ordered to activate a
                device called the Forest Array hundreds of years ago but became trapped in the caves. After freeing her,
                Cal travels to the Array, where he has a vision of two High Republic Jedi, Dagan Gera and Santari Khri,
                who discovered the mythical planet of Tanalorr hidden behind the supposedly impassable Koboh Abyss
                nebula. Cal activates the Array and discovers Dagan suspended in a bacta tank. Cal frees Dagan in hopes
                of recruiting a fellow Jedi, but discovers that Dagan has fallen to the dark side of the Force, angry at
                the Jedi Order for having abandoned Tanalorr. Dagan fights Cal before escaping with the help of Rayvis
                and the Bedlam Raiders.

                Realizing the value of a planet inaccessible to the Empire, Cal, Bode, and Greez repair the Stinger
                Mantis and head for the planet Jedha, where Cere has been working with Merrin and a still-alive Eno
                Cordova to rebuild the Jedi Archives with the help of a resistance organization called the Hidden Path.

                Cere and Cordova use the Archives to research Koboh and Tanalorr. Cordova explains that Dagan was the
                first and only pilot who managed to find a path through the Koboh Abyss. Khri developed special
                compasses to navigate it, and the Republic then established a settlement and Jedi Temple on Tanalorr.
                However, a group of raiders known as the Nihil assaulted Tanalorr, causing the Republic to withdraw from
                the planet and order the destruction of the compasses to keep the Nihil from using them. Dagan became
                obsessed with Tanalorr, believing it was his by right. After Dagan murdered several Jedi while
                attempting to retrieve one of the compasses, Khri severed his arm and trapped him in the bacta tank.
                Cordova notes that three compasses are still unaccounted for. Cal, Merrin, Bode, and Greez decide to
                search for them; Bode wishes to find a refuge for his young daughter Kata, while Merrin believes that
                the Hidden Path could use Tanalorr as their new home. During their journey, Cal and Merrin confess their
                feelings for each other and decide to pursue a relationship.

                Two compasses are unsalvageable, but after Cal, with Bode's help, defeats and kills Rayvis and Dagan,
                they discover one that Cordova is able to repair. Shortly after, the Empire launches an attack on Jedha.
                As chaos erupts, Bode steals the compass and murders Cordova. Cal tries to stop Bode from escaping, but
                Bode defeats him using Dagan's lightsaber, revealing himself to be not only an Imperial spy but a former
                Jedi who has since fallen to the dark side. Meanwhile, Cere prevents the Empire's forces from reaching
                the archive, but is killed while holding off Darth Vader to buy time for the Hidden Path to escape.
                Furious at Bode's betrayal, Cal uses a locator beacon to track his location to an Imperial Security
                Bureau (ISB) base in the Nova Garon system, commanded by Lank Denvik.

                After infiltrating the base, Cal eventually confronts Bode, who reveals that he worked in intelligence
                for the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars but disappeared when the Jedi Purge began. After the
                Inquisitorius killed his wife, Bode made a deal with Denvik to work for the ISB as a spy in exchange for
                keeping him and his daughter hidden from Vader. Revealing that he lured Cal to Nova Garon to create a
                distraction, hoping to be free of the ISB on his rendezvous to Tanalorr, Bode escapes with Kata and the
                compass. Cal briefly embraces the dark side in order to escape the garrison, though he stops himself
                from succumbing fully by sparing Denvik after Merrin talks him down.

                Cal recovers a recording left behind by Khri, explaining that the arrays on Koboh can be used to open an
                alternate path through the Koboh Abyss. After narrowly navigating the abyss, the group arrives at
                Tanalorr in one piece. There, Cal, Merrin, and Kata attempt to convince Bode to back down, but he
                refuses and attacks them. Bode overpowers Cal, forcing him to embrace the dark side to overpower him.
                Cal attempts to give Bode a second chance, but Bode refuses and nearly kills Merrin. Cal, seeing that
                his former friend is now beyond redemption, fatally shoots Bode.

                Afterward, they hold a Jedi funeral for Cere, Cordova, and Bode to mourn their passing. With the planet
                now under their control, Cal, Merrin, and Greez decide to adopt Kata and plan to make contact with the
                Hidden Path to relocate them to Tanalorr.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor retains many of the gameplay mechanics from its predecessor and introduces new
                elements. In lightsaber combat, Cal Kestis has access to five different lightsaber types, each with
                unique features. He can use the single blade and double blade stances from the previous game, Fallen
                Order, and the special dual-wield blade attack is expanded into its own stance. The dual-wield stance
                was originally intended to be a playable stance in Fallen Order, but it was only included as a special
                attack due to time constraints.[3] A new stance has also been added that uses a Kylo Ren-style
                crossguard lightsaber, which requires players to pay attention to timing windows to use effectively,
                particularly when blocking and parrying enemy attacks.[4] The second new stance is the blaster stance
                which allows the player to use a lightsaber and blaster combo allowing for both close and ranged
                attacks.[5] These different stances are designed to be used to combat specific types of enemies, which
                game director Stig Asmussen says will make the player "figure out what the best weapon of choice is".[6]
                Cal's Force Slow ability, which was previously used frequently in short bursts to overcome obstacles and
                slow individual enemies, has now been reworked in Survivor to purely function as an ultimate ability
                that can be unleashed in battle after a long cooldown to slow the entire world around Cal,[7] including
                enemies and mid-air projectiles, similar to Kylo Ren's Force Stasis ability in Star Wars: The Force
                Awakens.[8] Player cosmetic customization options have been greatly expanded in Survivor over the
                limited options available in Fallen Order.[9] Survivor allows the player to customize Cal's entire
                outfit,[10] along with his hairstyle and facial hair.[11] A white blade is a new color option in
                lightsaber customization.[12]
