            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>After more than a year of training under Peter Parker,[b] Miles Morales has mastered his superpowers and
                established himself as the original Spider-Man's crime-fighting partner, though he still struggles to
                adapt into his new role. While he and Peter escort a police transport carrying prisoners to the rebuilt
                Raft, Miles accidentally releases several inmates, including Rhino. While trying to stop Rhino's rampage
                through the city, Peter is knocked unconscious. Miles intervenes to protect him and defeats Rhino with
                his new bio-electric ability, later dubbed "Venom". Leaving Rhino in the custody of energy corporation
                Roxxon, headed by Simon Krieger, Peter informs Miles that he will be going to Symkaria for a few weeks
                to assist Mary Jane as her photographer as she does her story on the country's civil war, and entrusts
                Miles to look after New York in his absence as its sole Spider-Man.

                Later, Miles investigates a break-in at Roxxon Plaza and stops a hi-tech criminal group called the
                Underground from stealing Roxxon's new experimental power source, Nuform. Returning home to celebrate
                Christmas with Rio and Ganke, Miles is surprised to learn that Rio also invited Phin, with whom he has
                not spoken in months. The next day, Ganke creates a Spider-Man app so citizens can call Miles for help
                directly. Miles' uncle, Aaron Davis, is the first to use it and reveals his knowledge of his nephew's
                identity as Spider-Man.

                Miles soon witnesses the conflict between the Underground and Roxxon escalate, as the former attack one
                of Rio's campaign rallies in front of Roxxon Plaza and a Roxxon transport carrying Nuform on the
                Braithwaite Bridge. Miles tries to prevent the Underground from stealing the Nuform, discovering Phin is
                the Tinkerer in the process, but his Venom Power causes most of the Nuform to explode, destroying the
                bridge and damaging his public image. Ganke gives him a peptalk and reminds Miles that for now, he is
                New York's only Spider-Man, encouraging Miles to become better and making his own unique Spider-Man
                costume in the process. While investigating Phin's connection to the Underground, Miles discovers that
                her brother Rick created Nuform during his work for Roxxon, but soon became sick due to its unstable
                properties. Phin and Rick sought to expose the dangers of Nuform to the public, but while trying to shut
                down a Nuform reactor, the latter was killed by Krieger, who subsequently took credit for Nuform's
                creation. With the help of Aaron as the Prowler, Miles infiltrates a Roxxon lab to retrieve Phin's phone
                containing evidence of Krieger's crimes, but the phone is destroyed during his escape.

                At Aaron's advice, Miles uses his friendship with Phin to infiltrate the Underground and learn more
                about their plans. He discovers that Phin created the Underground's advanced weaponry out of a special
                component, programmable matter, in exchange for their help in exacting revenge on Krieger, which she
                plans to achieve by sabotaging the Nuform reactor at Roxxon Plaza to destroy it and expose Nuform's
                dangerous side effects. However, Miles is soon forced to reveal his identity as Spider-Man to Phin in
                order to save his own life, souring their friendship. While meeting with Phin to try and reconcile with
                her, the two are captured by Roxxon with the aid of Rhino, whose exosuit has been enhanced by Roxxon
                tech. Miles and Phin escape, but the former learns that Aaron has been spying on him for Roxxon and that
                Krieger modified the plaza's Nuform reactor to destroy Harlem if Phin's plan succeeds. After being
                defeated, Rhino taunts Phin about Rick's death, causing her to viciously attack him. Miles intervenes to
                stop her from killing Rhino, but a furious Phin escapes after knocking Miles out.

                Ganke brings an injured Miles home, where Rio discovers her son's identity as Spider-Man, but continues
                to support him. After recovering, Miles heads off to stop Phin, but is captured by Aaron, who imprisons
                him underground to prevent him from being killed like his father Jefferson Davis, whom Aaron was unable
                to reconcile with prior to his death, resulting in his over protectiveness of Miles. Miles escapes and
                defeats Aaron, explaining that he cannot turn his back on people when they need him. Inspired by his
                nephew's words, Aaron assists Rio with evacuating Harlem as the Underground and Roxxon fight on the
                streets, allowing Miles to head to Roxxon Plaza to stop Phin.

                Unable to reason with Phin, Miles fights her before attempting to absorb the Nuform from the reactor to
                negate the blast, but the amount of energy proves too much to handle. Phin, realizing the error of her
                ways, flies Miles to a safe distance above the city so that he can release the energy, killing her in
                the process. Miles plummets to the ground, where his identity is exposed to a few citizens he helped as
                Spider-Man, who promise to keep his secret and hail him as a hero.

                Four weeks later, Roxxon has been dealt numerous lawsuits, Krieger has been arrested following Aaron
                turning himself in and testifying against Krieger, and Miles is hailed not only as a superhero, but the
                local Spider-Man of Harlem. Peter returns home from Symkaria and praises Miles for his growth and
                heroism before they head off to fight crime together.

                In a mid-credits scene, Norman Osborn orders a reluctant Curt Connors to release his terminally ill son
                Harry from stasis despite the latter's unstable condition.

                In a post-credits scene, Miles leaves an award he won with Phin atop Trinity Church in her memory.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>The core gameplay of Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales is the same of its predecessor. It features the
                same open world, a fictionalized version of modern-day Manhattan, which is covered in snow because the
                game is set during Christmas. Miles controls similarly to Peter Parker, but with new animations and
                abilities, which are unlocked as the storyline progresses. The new powers include Venom Blast, which
                allows the player to incapacitate enemies with bio-electricity, and charge or drain electronics;
                Camouflage, which gives Miles temporary invisibility; and Mega Venom Blast, consisting of a massive
                explosion of bio-electricity that damages all nearby enemies. The game introduces new gadgets, such as
                Remote Mines, which can attach to enemies or electrical panels; a device that summons holographic
                fighters to help in combat; and Gravity Wells that trap multiple enemies and make them easier to hit.
                Miles' abilities and gadgets can be upgraded as the player levels up via a skill tree system. Another
                feature that the game offers is Miles' Spider-Man app which gives him feedback on crimes happening in
                New York City and the location of these crimes. It informs the player of any side missions that are
                available for them to complete, which is beneficial to level up.

                Miles possesses a "spider sense", which warns the player of incoming attacks and allows them to dodge
                and retaliate, and web-shooters, which fire lines of webs that can be used during both traversal and
                combat, in several different ways. Miles can also jump large distances, stick to surfaces, and fast
                travel using the New York City Subway system. There are several unlockable suits for Miles, some of
                which are based on existing versions of the character in media, as well as original suits created for
                the game. Many of these enhance Miles' abilities, such as allowing him to take more damage, stay
                invisible for a longer time, or regenerate Venom Power faster. During certain sections of the game,
                players control Miles in his civilian persona and cannot use any of his abilities or gadgets.
