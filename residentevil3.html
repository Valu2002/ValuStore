            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>On September 28, 1998, 24 hours prior to the events of Resident Evil 2, most of Raccoon City's citizens
                have turned into zombies as the result of an outbreak of the T-virus, a mutagenic virus secretly
                developed by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella. Jill Valentine, former member of the Raccoon Police
                Department's Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.), is attacked in her apartment by an
                intelligent bioweapon known as the Nemesis T-Type, specifically programmed by Umbrella to eliminate all
                surviving S.T.A.R.S. members. Briefly joined by fellow S.T.A.R.S. officer Brad Vickers before he is
                killed by zombies, Jill evades Nemesis and is rescued by Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service
                (U.B.C.S.) mercenary Carlos Oliveira. Carlos explains that he and his group of surviving U.B.C.S.
                mercenaries - Mikhail Victor, Tyrell Patrick, and Nicholai Ginovaef - have set up subway trains to
                evacuate civilians from the city. Jill helps them reactivate power to the subway and departs on a train
                with Nicholai and Mikhail, while Carlos and Tyrell remain behind to find Dr. Nathaniel Bard, an Umbrella
                scientist who may have developed a vaccine for the T-virus.

                After Mikhail expresses his suspicions towards Nicholai over how their platoon was ambushed by zombies,
                Nemesis attacks the train and kills the civilians. Nicholai betrays and locks Jill and Mikhail out, with
                the latter sacrificing himself by detonating an explosive that derails the train. Meanwhile, reaching
                the police department on the notion that Bard is at the S.T.A.R.S. office, Carlos and Tyrell learn the
                scientist took refuge at a nearby hospital. Carlos is contacted by Jill, who survived the crash while
                being pursued by a mutating Nemesis. She manages to escape Nemesis, losing consciousness after the
                monster infects her with the T-virus. Carlos finds Jill half a day later and takes her to the hospital,
                finding Bard murdered along with the scientist's video entry revealing that Umbrella's board is wiping
                out the vaccines and any evidence connecting the company to the T-Virus. After Carlos retrieves Bard's
                vaccine and administers it to Jill, Tyrell discovers that the U.S. government plans to destroy Raccoon
                City in a missile strike to eradicate the T-virus infestation. Carlos travels to a lab underneath the
                hospital to find more vaccines, while Tyrell tries to contact whoever he can to prevent the missile
                strike.

                Jill wakes on the day of the missile strike, October 1, and follows Carlos to the lab. Tyrell informs
                her that the U.S. government will not launch the missiles if they can retrieve a vaccine from the lab
                within a few hours. Although Nemesis kills Tyrell shortly afterwards, Jill manages to synthesize a
                vaccine. She also learns that Nicholai is a supervisor hired by an unknown contractor to sabotage
                Umbrella's efforts to hide their involvement while collecting combat data on the company's bioweapons,
                including Nemesis. An encounter with Nemesis prompts Nicholai to retrieve the vaccine from Jill as he
                leaves her to fight the monster. Jill eliminates Nemesis with a railgun and meets up with Nicholai at a
                helipad. Nicholai destroys the vaccine, acknowledging that the city's fate is not important as long as
                he gets paid for sabotaging Umbrella. Carlos intervenes and restrains Nicholai, prompting Jill to shoot
                and injure him. Disgusted by his greed, Jill escapes the city with Carlos via helicopter, leaving
                Nicholai behind. As the city is destroyed by the missile strike, Jill vows to take down Umbrella at all
                costs.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Resident Evil 3 is a survival horror third-person shooter game.[2] The player controls Resident Evil
                protagonist Jill Valentine through most of the game; certain sections require the player to control a
                supporting character, Carlos Oliveira, for short periods.[3] The player must explore the environment to
                open doors, climb ladders, and pick up items. When an item is collected, it is stored in an inventory
                that can be accessed at any time. Items in the inventory can be used, examined, and combined to solve
                puzzles and gain access to areas that were previously inaccessible.[4] The player may pick up maps to
                reveal unexplored sections in the game's automap, which shows the player's current position and
                indicates if an area still has items to collect.[5] Cutscenes with occasional quick time events are
                featured at regular intervals to advance the story.[6]

                As the player progresses throughout the game, a variety of computer-controlled monsters will try to
                hinder the player's progress.[3] The player can acquire and use multiple weapons, including combat
                knives, firearms, and grenades.[7] Some weapons can be customized with additional parts to improve their
                performance.[8] A creature called Nemesis is the game's primary antagonist and pursues the player in key
                moments.[9] He gradually mutates into more aggressive forms as the player defeats him during several
                encounters.[10] The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when Jill or Carlos take
                damage.[11] On higher difficulty settings, ammunition and health recovery items are scarce, and getting
                past opponents without killing them is generally encouraged.[12] Jill has the ability to dodge incoming
                attacks at close range, while Carlos can perform melee attacks to stagger opponents.[13] If Jill or
                Carlos die, the player must start the game again from the last save point.[9]

                Once the player completes the game on the highest difficulty setting, two additional difficulty modes
                can be unlocked. These disable autosaves, make opponents tougher to defeat, change certain encounters,
                and rearrange item locations.[14] Additionally, upon completing the game for the first time, an item
                shop is unlocked in the game's main menu, allowing the player to spend points on in-game advantages such
                as items that boost the player's healing and damage, as well as new weapons. Points are earned by
                completing a number of challenges, ranging from finding all weapon upgrades to destroying hidden
                bobbleheads known as Charlie dolls.[15] Unlocking items is essential to completing the game's most
                challenging difficulty modes.</p>
