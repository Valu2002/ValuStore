            <p>Fall Guys (formerly known as Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout)[1] is a free-to-play platform battle royale
                game developed by Mediatonic and published by Epic Games. The game involves up to 32 players who control
                bean-shaped characters and compete against each other in a series of randomly selected mini-games such
                as obstacle courses and survival challenges. Players are eliminated as the rounds progress until,
                eventually, the last remaining player is crowned the winner. The game draws inspiration from game shows
                like Takeshi's Castle, It's a Knockout, Wipeout, and playground games like tag and British
                Bulldog.[2][3]

                The game was released by Devolver Digital for PlayStation 4 and Windows on 4 August 2020. Following
                their acquisition of Mediatonic, the publishing rights were transferred to Epic Games. Subsequently, the
                game was made free-to-play on 21 June 2022 and released on additional platforms including Nintendo
                Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, with full cross-platform play support among all
                platforms.[4][5] As part of the transition, the game adapted a battle pass system for its monetization,
                offering avatar customizations to players.

                Fall Guys received positive reviews from critics for its chaotic gameplay and visual appearance. The
                game was a commercial success, selling more than 10 million copies and attracting more than 50 million
                players after the game went free-to-play. Since launch Mediatonic has released numerous updates.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Up to 32 players compete in shows with battle royale-style gameplay.[6][7][8] Players, represented as
                jellybean-like figures,[9] move around in a three-dimensional playing field, with additional moves such
                as jumping, grabbing/climbing, or diving to assist gameplay.[10] The aim is to qualify for subsequent
                rounds by successfully completing each of the randomly selected mini-games with randomly selected
                variations.[11][12] Certain mini-games include: Course rounds in which players need to make it to the
                finish line, Survival rounds in which players need to not get knocked off into the slime, Hunt rounds in
                which players need to collect items to win, Logic rounds in which players need to use their memory, Team
                rounds in which players are part of a team and need to win against the other teams, Invisibeans rounds
                in which there are 2 teams, with 1 team being invisible, and final rounds in which the remaining few
                players compete in a final match with a randomised mini-game designed for a smaller player size.[10] The
                winner of the match is the last player standing or the first to finish.[13]

                Using an in-game currency, "Kudos", players can purchase single cosmetics, nameplates, nametags,
                patterns, faceplates, and colours, for their character to show off in-game.[14][15] Players obtain Kudos
                by completing the fame pass, or in events. Players receive crowns by winning a match.[16] Crowns were a
                premium currency until 21 June 2022, whereas they now only count towards Crown Rank. Any Crowns that
                users did not spend before the game went free to play were converted into Kudos.[17]

                Players can also use "Show Bucks", a paid currency that's only available through the fame pass in
                limited quantities or through microtransactions. Show Bucks can be used to purchase everything kudos
                sells as well as full costumes and celebrations.
