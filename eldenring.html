            <p>Early in their journey to repair the Elden Ring, the player-character Tarnished encounters a maiden named
                Melina. Because the Tarnished is maidenless, Melina offers to act as their maiden, granting them the
                ability to turn runes into strength and giving the Tarnished a steed named Torrent. In exchange, Melina
                requires the Tarnished to take her to the Erdtree, the home of the Elden Ring. Melina later takes the
                Tarnished to the Roundtable Hold, a gathering place for other Tarnished seeking to repair the Elden
                Ring. The Hold's benefactor, the Two Fingers, instructs the Tarnished to collect the Great Runes and
                bring them to the Erdtree, where they can be used to repair the Elden Ring.

                The Tarnished travels into the Lands Between, investigating its locales and defeating the demigods.
                After recovering at least two Great Runes, the Two Fingers allows them to battle Morgott the
                Grace-Given, the demigod guarding the Erdtree. The Tarnished defeats Morgott but finds a wall of thorns
                blocking the Erdtree's interior. Melina arrives and advises the Tarnished to find the Flame of Ruin,
                which they can use to ignite the Erdtree and destroy the thorns. The Tarnished is free to travel towards
                the Flame of Ruin or search for a way to harness the equally powerful Frenzied Flame.

                If, upon obtaining the Flame of Ruin, the Tarnished did not gain the power of the Frenzied Flame, Melina
                takes the Flame of Ruin and sacrifices herself to set alight the Erdtree. If the Tarnished gained the
                power of the Frenzied Flame, Melina abandons the Tarnished, forcing them to use the Frenzied Flame to
                set alight the Erdtree. While the Erdtree burns, the Tarnished is transported to the ruined city Farum
                Azula. After defeating Maliketh the Black Blade and using his Rune of Death to fuel the fire, the
                Tarnished is returned to the foot of the scorched Erdtree. Inside, they fight Radagon, Queen Marika's
                consort cohabitating her body, and the tree's guardian the Elden Beast. After both are vanquished, the
                Tarnished gains access to Marika's shattered corpse, which contains the remains of the Elden Ring.
                Depending on the Tarnished's actions during the game, six different endings can be achieved; the primary
                of which include the Tarnished becoming the Elden Lord, the Elden Ring being destroyed by Ranni the
                Witch, and the Tarnished using the Frenzied Flame to destroy the Lands Between. The three alternate
                endings include an Age of Order, brought about by perfecting the Elden Ring, the Age of the Duskborn,
                embedding the principle of "Life within Death" into Order, and the Blessing of Despair, overtaking the
                Lands Between with a reviled curse.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Elden Ring is an action role-playing game set in third-person perspective. It includes elements that are
                similar to those in other FromSoftware-developed games, such as the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, and
                Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. The game is set in an open world; players can freely explore the Lands
                Between and its six main areas, which include Limgrave—an area of grassy plains and ancient ruins—and
                Caelid, a wasteland that is home to undead monsters.[1] The open world is explored using the character's
                mount Torrent as the main mode of transportation, though players may use fast travel outside combat.
                Throughout the game, players encounter non-player characters (NPCs) and enemies, including demigods who
                rule each main area and serve as the game's main bosses.[2][3] Aside from the main areas, Elden Ring has
                hidden dungeons, catacombs, tunnels, and caves where players can fight bosses and gather helpful
                items.[4]

                At the game's start, the player chooses a character class, which determines their starting spells,
                equipment, and attributes.[5] Combat with enemies can be within melee, or from a distance using ranged
                weapons. Enemy attacks can be dodged or blocked using shields. Spells allow players to enhance their
                weapons, fight enemies from afar, and restore lost hit points. The player can memorize a limited amount
                of these spells, which can be cast using a staff or sacred seal item.[6][7] Weapons can be improved
                using ashes of war, which are obtainable "enchantments" that grant weapons new capabilities. Ashes of
                war can be applied to or removed from weapons, and each Ash adds a weapon art, a special ability that
                can be used during combat.[8] Aside from direct combat, stealth mechanics can be used to avoid enemies
                or allow the targeting of foes with critical hits while hidden.[9][10] Staggering enemies and parrying
                their attacks can also create opportunities for critical hits.[11][12]

                Checkpoints called sites of grace are located throughout the game; in these places, characters can
                increase the power of their attributes, change memorized spells, swap ashes of war, or walk to using
                fast travel. Upon death, players respawn at the last site of grace they interacted with. Alternatively,
                they may choose to respawn at certain locations highlighted by "stakes of Marika" provided they died
                nearby.[8][13][14] To increase their attributes at sites of grace, the player must spend runes, an
                in-game currency that is acquired by defeating enemies.[15] Runes can be used to buy items, and improve
                weapons and armor. Dying in Elden Ring causes the player to lose all collected runes at the location of
                death; if the player dies again before retrieving the runes, they will be lost forever.[16]

                Elden Ring contains crafting mechanics; the creation of items requires materials. Recipes, which are
                required for the crafting of items, can be found inside collectibles called cookbooks, which are
                scattered throughout the world. Materials can be collected by defeating enemies, exploring the game's
                world, or by trading with merchant NPCs. Crafted items include poison darts, exploding pots, and
                consumables that temporarily increase the player's combat strength.[17][18] Similar to the Dark Souls
                games, the player can summon friendly NPCs called spirits to fight enemies.[19] Summoning each type of
                spirit requires its equivalent Spirit Ash; different types of Spirit Ashes can be discovered as the
                player explores the game world. Spirits can only be summoned near structures called Rebirth Monuments,
                which are primarily found in large areas and inside boss fight arenas.[20]

                Elden Ring has a multiplayer system that allows players to be summoned for both cooperative and
                player-versus-player (PvP) play over the Internet.[21] Cooperative play involves the placing of a summon
                sign on the ground, which causes the sign to become visible to online players who have used a
                corresponding item. If another player interacts with the sign, the player who placed the sign is
                summoned into their world. Cooperative players remain in the same world until the boss of the area is
                defeated or until a summoned player dies and is returned to their home world. In PvP combat, a summon
                sign is used to challenge another player to a duel, or the player can use additional items to invade the
                worlds of others. World hosts may use a "taunter's tongue" to increase the likelihood their world will
                be invaded by others and to decrease the time between invasions.
