            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>The protagonist receives a letter from Professor Weasley, which confirms their attendance at Hogwarts
                School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as a fifth-year student and assigns Professor Fig as the protagonist's
                mentor. Fig escorts the protagonist from London to Hogwarts via a flying coach. While investigating an
                unknown artefact, a dragon attacks them, prompting the two to reach for a Portkey hidden inside the
                artefact that teleports them to Gringotts. Using the Portkey to enter an old vault, the protagonist
                learns they can see traces of ancient magic. The duo is confronted by a hostile goblin named Ranrok
                before escaping to Hogwarts, where the protagonist is sorted into one of the four houses.

                The protagonist learns various spells during classes and goes on a trip to Hogsmeade with a companion,
                where a troll sent by Ranrok attacks them and is defeated by them. The protagonist also sneaks into the
                library and finds a book with missing pages. While Professor Fig studies the book, the protagonist
                locates the missing pages and finds a secret room below Hogwarts known as the Map Chamber, where they
                later visit several times with Fig and talk to the portraits of four deceased Hogwarts professors who
                refer to themselves as the "Keepers", whose goal is to protect the secrets of ancient magic from the
                wizarding world.

                To reveal the secrets of ancient magic, the protagonist completes four trials left by the Keepers. The
                trials feature complicated puzzles and dangerous tasks that require the skills the protagonist has
                acquired, each leading to a Pensieve, a magical device used to store and review memories. The
                protagonist learns from the memories that Isidora Morganach, a Hogwarts student who became a professor
                with abilities similar to the protagonist, was in conflict with the Keepers and left behind a hidden
                repository of ancient magic after using it to extract negative emotions, particularly from her suffering
                father. The Keepers realised that Isidora was inhaling the extracted emotions to increase her own power
                and failed to dissuade her, forcing one of them to eliminate her with the Killing Curse. Through their
                other adventures, the protagonist also learns that Ranrok, the leader of an ongoing goblin rebellion
                against wizards, seeks to find the repository and exploit it for his own ends. To locate it, he
                collaborates with a group of dark wizards led by Victor Rookwood, a descendant of one of the Keepers.

                After the protagonist completes all trials, they receive one final task from the Keepers: to create a
                special type of magic wand from the artefacts found at the Pensieves. Professor Fig sends the
                protagonist to Gerbold Ollivander, the wandmaker, in order to craft the special wand. As the protagonist
                leaves Ollivander's, they are ambushed by Victor, who proposes an alliance against the goblins. The
                protagonist refuses, resulting in a battle in which the protagonist manages to defeat him. Shortly
                after, the protagonist and Professor Fig find the repository intact, and the protagonist makes their
                choice between keeping the magic sealed away or absorbing the power for themselves. Ranrok then locates
                Isidora's repository and absorbs the ancient power, transforming himself into a dragon. Fig is mortally
                wounded, and the protagonist battles the dragon, ending the goblin rebellion by destroying Ranrok and
                doing as they chose earlier. Regardless of their choice, Fig dies, and Headmaster Black and Professor
                Weasley hold a eulogy in honour of him.

                The protagonist returns to finish regular school studies, as the end of the school year is leading to
                the O.W.L. exams. They also continue to explore the castle's surrounding areas and go through adventures
                with companions Sebastian Sallow, Poppy Sweeting, and Natsai Onai if they haven't completed them
                already. The journey ends with Professor Weasley awarding the protagonist 100 house points for the
                extraordinary adventure, which ultimately leads to a win of the House Cup for their respective house.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Hogwarts Legacy is an action role-playing game played from a third-person perspective. It is set at
                Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and its surrounding areas, influenced by the Wizarding World
                franchise.[4][5] During character creation, the player can choose their character's appearance, gender,
                voice, and body type. They may also choose one of the four Hogwarts Houses.[6] As players progress
                through the game, their player character learns to cast spells, brew potions, and master combat
                abilities, eventually developing their own special combat style.[7][8] Through in-game challenges, the
                player character can earn experience points to gain levels, which allows the player to access and
                upgrade different spells, talents, and abilities. These challenges come in the form of combat, quests,
                and exploration. Player characters can establish friendships with non-player characters (NPCs). As these
                relationships grow, schoolmates become companions who can accompany players on their journey, expand
                their abilities, and offer unique companion quests as players learn their stories.[9] Each of the four
                Hogwarts Houses—Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin—also offers a unique common room; these
                rooms are only accessible for the player's current house chosen by the Sorting Hat.[10] Accompanied by
                the choice of house, the player receives different exclusive quests.[11] While house points for the four
                Hogwarts houses play a part in the game's plot, they are not influenced by player actions.[12]
