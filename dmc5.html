            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Following the events of Devil May Cry 4, Nero works as a demon hunter for Dante's Devil May Cry agency
                along with his friend, gunsmith Nico Goldstein. One afternoon, Nero is working at the agency when a
                hooded man enters. Nero offers the stranger food when he suddenly rips off his demonic Devil Bringer
                arm, which transforms into the Yamato sword. The stranger uses the sword to open a portal and departs.

                Three days later, a mysterious man named V hires Dante and his crew to take down a powerful demon named
                Urizen.[10] The group travels to Red Grave City, where they find a demonic tree called Qliphoth planted
                in the city, killing people for their blood. Nero, working on his own, is also pinpointed toward Urizen
                by V.[11] Dante's crew confronts Urizen but, empowered by the Qliphoth, the new demon king incapacitates
                them and overpowers Nero when he intervenes. Dante stops Urizen from capturing Nero but is defeated and
                ejected from the Qliphoth with his sword Rebellion shattered. His allies Lady and Trish are captured to
                be used as demon-cores while V convinces the weakened Nero to escape.[12][13]

                One month later, Nero returns to Red Grave outfitted with the "Devil Breaker" prosthetic arm, made by
                Nico.[14][15] Nero meets up with V, who is seeking Qliphoth for its fruit—born of condensed human
                blood—which makes whoever consumes it the king of the Underworld. As the pair destroy the Qliphoth's
                roots while searching for Dante, Nero rescues Lady[16] while V splits off to discover the Devil Sword
                Sparda - along with a comatose Dante, whose presence was hidden by the sword.[17]

                After awakening from his coma, Dante frees Trish and begins fighting his way to Urizen.[18] Trish learns
                from V that Urizen is the demon-side of Dante's brother Vergil, who used Yamato's power to separate his
                demon and human halves - the latter manifesting as V, whose body is rapidly breaking down.[19][20]
                Realizing Yamato has an unbelievable capability of separating humanity and the devil, Dante questions
                whether his Rebellion also has a hidden potential, believing both legacy weapons have incredible power
                on their own. After stabbing himself with his broken Rebellion, Dante unlocks his full demonic power and
                a new weapon, the "Devil Sword Dante," by absorbing Rebellion and the Devil Sword Sparda into his
                body.[21] Nero attempts to confront Urizen again and is overpowered once more, but Dante rescues him[22]
                and gains the upper hand with his new powers. Urizen takes his leave when the Qliphoth bears fruit and
                consumes it to empower himself further.[23] While Dante arrives first to face Urizen, Nero rescues V
                from the demon Malphas and learns of Dante's history with Vergil.[24] Nero and V reach Dante just as he
                defeats Urizen, but a dying V intervenes and merges with Urizen before Dante can finish him, reviving
                Vergil.[25]

                Vergil returns to the top of the Qliphoth, telling Dante to recover his full strength before they battle
                again.[26] Nero insists on going after Vergil himself, but Dante reveals that Vergil is Nero's father,
                and refuses to let Nero kill him.[27] Dante then faces V's familiars - revealed as the embodied memories
                of Vergil's time as Nelo Angelo - and they elect to die by Dante's hand to lessen Vergil's
                trauma.[28][29]

                Dante and Vergil fight again, where Vergil learns Nero is his unintended son.[30] Nero settles his
                emotions in a phone call to Kyrie and resolves not to let his father and uncle die, fully awakening his
                demonic powers and regrowing his arm.[31] Intervening in their fight and forcing Dante out, Nero vows to
                end the pair's sibling rivalry[32] and defeats Vergil,[33] who gives Nero V's book as a memento.[34]
                Vergil joins Dante in a one-way trip to the Underworld to cut the Qliphoth down and seal the portal
                connecting it before it rips Red Grave City apart and merges the Demon World with the Human World,[35]
                with Nero departing as the Qliphoth falls.

                Weeks later, Trish and Lady are hired for a new job by Dante's agent, Morrison, whom Dante left in
                charge of his office.[36][37] In the Underworld, Dante and Vergil continue sparring as they fight demons
                together, now friendly rivals instead of enemies.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>The gameplay features the return of Dante and Nero as playable characters, along with a new character,
                named V.[2] The gameplay is similar to that of the other titles in the Devil May Cry series, focusing on
                fast-paced "stylish action"; the player fights off hordes of demons with a variety of attacks and
                weapons. They receive a style rating for combat based on several factors, such as move variety, the
                length of a combo, and dodging attacks. The game's music changes based on the player's performance in
                combat.[3] Every time the player interacts with the mechanic Nico or finds a statue, they can buy new
                abilities for each character. While there are three playable characters, the game forces the player to
                use only one per mission. Like previous games, this title has a Bloody Palace mode where players can
                face multiple types of demons in a single area.[4]

                The first character is Nero, introduced in Devil May Cry 4. He retains his Red Queen sword for melee
                combat and the Blue Rose double-barreled revolver. However, he does not have his Devil Bringer from the
                beginning. Instead, he now has an assortment of new robotic arms called Devil Breakers. These have
                various functions, such as grabbing enemies from a distance or stopping time to freeze an enemy in
                place. Nero can also find Devil Breakers during stages. Devil Breakers are powerful but fragile and can
                be destroyed if misused.[5] Late in the story, Nero regains his Devil Bringer and has access to the
                Devil Trigger move, which expands his combat skills.

                Dante plays like his Devil May Cry 4 persona as he can change between four styles to create new
                techniques or parry enemy attacks. Along with his signature blade "Rebellion" and the Demonic "Devil
                Sword Sparda", Dante uses three new Devil Arms, a pair of buzzsaw-like weapons that combine into a
                motorcycle called "Cavaliere", and a set of fiery gauntlets and boots called "Balrog". Dante also wields
                "King Cerberus", a stronger version of the "Cerberus" nunchaku introduced in Devil May Cry 3. He also
                wears the "Dr. Faust", a hat that requires red orbs to attack; it is a risk/reward weapon depending on
                the player's actions. Dante can also use both "Kalina Ann" from Devil May Cry 3 and the new enhanced
                "Kalina Ann 2," or both at once.[6] Besides the Devil Trigger that enhances Dante's abilities and
                restores his health, the character also possesses a more overpowered form named "Sin Devil Trigger"
                which produces new means of attacks.[7]

                The third playable character is V, who primarily summons his three demon familiars to fight. These
                include Griffon, an eagle that uses ranged lightning-based attacks; Shadow, a panther that forms blades,
                spikes, and portals out of its body; and Nightmare, a large and powerful golem. V enters a Devil
                Trigger-like state, which turns his hair white, to summon Nightmare, which uses a combination of melee
                attacks and explosive laser beams. V's familiars are incapable of killing enemies; once their health bar
                turns light purple, V uses his cane to finish them off with a final blow.[8]

                Vergil reappears as a playable character in the game's Special Edition, carrying over his playstyle from
                the fourth game's Special Edition, including the Concentration gauge system and weaponry. However, the
                Force Edge from previous Special Edition games is replaced with Mirage Edge, an ethereal sword that
                Vergil usually uses as a projectile summon. He has a new ability, which allows him to turn into V and
                gather his trio of demonic familiars to deal a wide range of damages to enemies. Instead of transforming
                into his regular Devil Trigger form, Vergil immediately transforms into his Sin Devil Trigger upgrade.
                His original Devil Trigger is now replaced with Doppelganger, a summoned spectral copy of his Sin Devil
                Trigger form which mirrors Vergil's attacks (with the Yamato only), which was a mechanic introduced in
                Devil May Cry 3 as Dante's Doppelganger Style, then reintroduced as the Devil Trigger ability for the
                reboot Vergil in DmC: Devil May Cry.
