            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>The game begins with the selection of one of three lifepaths for the player character V: Nomad,
                Streetkid, or Corpo. All three lifepaths involve V starting a new life in Night City with local thug
                Jackie Welles and working together as mercenaries with a netrunner, T-Bug.

                In 2077, local fixer Dexter "Dex" DeShawn hires V and Jackie to steal a biochip known as "the Relic"
                from Arasaka Corporation. They acquire the Relic, but the plan goes awry when they witness the murder of
                the megacorp's leader Saburo Arasaka at the hands of his son Yorinobu. Yorinobu covers up the murder as
                poisoning and triggers a security sweep, in which Arasaka's netrunners kill T-Bug. V and Jackie escape,
                but the Relic's protective case is damaged and Jackie is fatally wounded in the process, forcing V to
                insert the biochip into the cyberware in their head.

                Furious at the unwanted police attention, Dex shoots V in the head and leaves them for dead in a
                landfill. Upon awakening, V is haunted by the digital ghost of war veteran turned iconic rock star and
                terrorist Johnny Silverhand, believed to have died in 2023 during his own thermonuclear attack on
                Arasaka Tower. V is then rescued by Saburo's bodyguard Goro Takemura on Arasaka's orders, as they are
                the prime suspect in Saburo's death. Upon recovering, V learns from their ripperdoc Viktor Vector that
                Dex's bullet triggered resurrection nanotech on the biochip, repairing the damage to V's brain but
                starting an irreversible process that would overwrite V’s behaviour and memories with Johnny’s, whose
                memory engram is stored on the chip, leaving V only a few weeks before the process completes. The
                biochip cannot be removed without instantly killing V, so V must find a way to remove Johnny and
                survive.

                Takemura later realizes V is innocent of Saburo's murder, and decides to work with them to avenge it.
                From here, V is able to follow up on two different leads: tracking down Arasaka's head doctor Anders
                Hellman, which V accomplishes by working with Panam Palmer, a member of the Aldecaldos nomad clan; and
                finding and rescuing Evelyn Parker, Dex's client who commissioned the gig.

                After finding and capturing Anders, V attempts to contact Evelyn Parker for help, only to learn that she
                was kidnapped by the Death's Head gang. With the help of Evelyn's friend Judy Álvarez, they are able to
                save her, but Evelyn is in a near-death state, leaving her unable to help. By viewing Evelyn's memories
                through a braindance, V is able to get in contact with the Voodoo Boys, a gang of netrunners.

                Through the Voodoo Boys, V relives Johnny's memories, learning that in 2013, Johnny's then-girlfriend
                Alt Cunningham created Soulkiller, an artificial intelligence able to copy netrunners' minds through
                their neural links, but destroyed the target's brain in the process. Arasaka kidnapped Alt and forced
                her to create their own version of Soulkiller, which would store the minds of its targets in Arasaka's
                digital fortress, Mikoshi. With the help of his friend Rogue Amendiares, Johnny led a rescue effort to
                save Alt, but failed to find her before Arasaka used Soulkiller on her; Johnny's later thermonuclear
                attack was a cover to free Alt's consciousness from Arasaka's subnet, but Arasaka's head of security
                Adam Smasher captured him and used Soulkiller on him as well. By 2077, Arasaka was advertising a "Secure
                Your Soul" program and conducting secret research into writing a digital copy of a mind into a living
                human brain, from which the Relic arose.

                V also gets in contact with Alt's consciousness, which has escaped beyond the Blackwall, a firewall
                which protects the net from rogue AIs. With Johnny's mediation, V makes a deal with Alt, that if they
                can give Alt access to Arasaka's subnet and gain physical access to Mikoshi, Alt can use Soulkiller to
                separate V's and Johnny's consciousness.

                Working with Takemura, V helps him capture Yorinobu's sister, Hanako Arasaka, to convince her of
                Yorinobu's treachery. After defeating Takemura's former student Oda, they are able to get Hanako to a
                safe house and convince her of V's innocence, but Arasaka soldiers attack, forcing V to flee.
                Eventually, V must decide whether to mount an attack on Arasaka Tower to gain physical access to Mikoshi
                and use Soulkiller to remove Johnny from their body, or to make a deal with Hanako to extract the Relic.

                If V chooses to attack Arasaka Tower, depending upon player actions throughout the game, V can choose
                different options to conduct the attack. V can allow Johnny to take over and stage the attack with
                Rogue, suppress Johnny and mount the attack with their nomad allies from the Aldecaldos clan, mount the
                attack solo, or simply commit suicide. All options (except for the suicide one) end with V defeating
                Adam Smasher. If V chooses to make a deal with Hanako instead, they convince the Arasaka board that
                Yorinobu killed Saburo, and oust Yorinobu as CEO, with V defeating Smasher. Hanako honors her deal with
                V and, after inserting an engram of Saburo into Yorinobu to avenge Saburo's murder, has Arasaka doctors
                extract the Relic from V. In all cases, it is revealed that the damage to V's body is irreversible.
                Depending on player choice, V either requests Arasaka upload them into Mikoshi until a suitable host
                body is found, remains in their body with an uncertain life expectancy, or allows Johnny to take over
                permanently (only achievable through attacking Arasaka). If V assaults Arasaka and chooses to remain in
                their body, they either become a Night City legend, or leave Night City with the Aldecaldos clan hoping
                to find a way to prolong their lifespan. If V surrenders their body to Johnny, the latter pays his
                respects to his friends and leaves Night City to start a new life.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is an action role-playing game[1] played from a first-person perspective as V,[2] a
                mercenary whose voice,[3] face, hairstyle, body type and modifications, background, and clothing are
                customisable. There are also five attributes (Body, Intelligence, Reflexes, Technical, and Cool) that
                can be customized to suit the player's gameplay style.

                The gameplay is flexible: the three primary play styles are Netrunner (hacking), Techie (machinery), and
                Solo (combat). V has a number of maneuvers to reposition in combat, including sprinting, taking cover,
                double-jumping, and sliding;[4][5] many of these abilities can be unlocked or upgraded through cyberware
                implants installed by a "ripperdoc".[6] Weapon use increases accuracy and reloading speed, which are
                reflected in character animations.[7] Equipment, such as weapons and armor, is governed by a coloured
                tier system[8] and is split into melee and ranged options. Melee strikes can be dealt with close-combat
                weapons.[9][10] There are three types of ranged weapons, all of which can be customised and
                modified—Power (with ricocheting bullets), Tech (which penetrates walls and enemies), and Smart (with
                homing bullets, only usable with specific cyberware).[11][12] The game has four types of damage that can
                be inflicted and resisted—Physical, Thermal, Electric, and Chemical.[13][14][15] The game can be
                completed without killing anyone (not including robots),[16] with non-lethal options for weapons and
                cyberware.[17]

                The open world metropolis of Night City consists of six regions: the corporate City Centre,
                immigrant-inhabited Watson, luxurious Westbrook, suburban Heywood, gang-infested Pacifica (and its
                anarchist Dogtown section), and industrial Santo Domingo. Its surrounding area, the Badlands, can also
                be explored. V navigates these locations on foot (in first-person view) and in vehicles (in either a
                third- or first-person view).[6] V owns an apartment and has access to a garage, and can purchase four
                additional apartments throughout the city.[9] There is a full day-night cycle and dynamic weather, which
                affects the way non-player characters (NPCs) behave.[11][18] Depending on the location, law enforcement
                may be alerted if V commits a crime.[19] Pedestrians are vulnerable to vehicular collisions and
                gunfire.[12][20] Radio stations are available to listen to.[21][22] Night City features many
                non-English-speaking characters, whose languages can be translated with special implants.[23] V also
                periodically uses a "Braindance," a device that allows one to undergo other people's
                experiences.[24][25]

                Branching dialogues enable interaction with NPCs and actions in quests[26] and the player's in-game
                choices can lead to different endings.[25] Experience points are obtained from main quests and used to
                upgrade stats; side quests yield "street cred", unlocking skills, vendors, places, and additional
                quests.[8][11][12][27] Quests are acquired from characters known as Fixers.[12] Throughout the game, V
                is aided by various companions.[9] Consumables, such as food, drinks, and drugs, are used for healing
                and temporary enhancements, and objects can be inspected in V's inventory.[5] Minigames include hacking,
                boxing, auto racing,[28] martial arts, and shooting ranges.
