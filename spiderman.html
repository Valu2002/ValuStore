            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Following the capture of Wilson Fisk by Spider-Man, a masked gang known as the Inner Demons begins
                seizing Fisk's illicit assets. Mary Jane and Spider-Man learn that the Demons are seeking something
                called Devil's Breath. With the aid of Officer Jefferson Davis, Spider-Man thwarts a Demon attack. Davis
                is lauded for his heroism at a re-election event for Mayor Norman Osborn. The Demons attack the event,
                killing Davis and many other attendees. Peter witnesses Martin Li transforming into their leader, Mister
                Negative, but is knocked unconscious before he can intervene. Following the attack, Osborn hires Silver
                Sablinova and Sable International to supplant the police. Peter befriends Davis' son, Miles Morales, and
                persuades him to volunteer at F.E.A.S.T.

                Peter and Otto Octavius continue their research into advanced prosthetic limbs, but Osborn withdraws
                their funding in an attempt to force Octavius to work for his mega-corporation Oscorp. While searching
                for Li, Spider-Man discovers that Devil's Breath is a lethal, virulent bioweapon inadvertently created
                by Oscorp while developing a cure for genetic diseases. Li locates and steals the only sample of Devil's
                Breath and threatens to release it unless Osborn surrenders to him. Mary Jane and Spider-Man foil Li,
                who is subsequently incarcerated at a nearby maximum-security prison called the Raft, while the Devil's
                Breath is secured.

                Meanwhile, Octavius obsesses over creating enhanced limbs that exceed the human body's limitations,
                creating four mechanical tentacles operated from his back and mentally controlled via a neural
                interface. He reveals to Peter that he is suffering from a neuromuscular disease that will inevitably
                immobilize him and that enhanced limbs will allow him to continue his work when his body fails. Peter
                warns Octavius that the interface could impact his mind and personality. Octavius continues its use in
                secret, overcome with anger at Osborn. While investigating a breakout at the Raft, Spider-Man learns
                that some of his greatest enemies—Li, Electro, Vulture, Rhino, and Scorpion—have escaped. They subdue
                Spider-Man and present him to Octavius, now "Doctor Octopus", who warns the beaten Spider-Man not to
                interfere before retaking the Devil's Breath and releasing it in Times Square, causing a mass outbreak
                that infects numerous people, including Aunt May. New York descends into chaos while Octavius' team
                attacks the city. Osborn declares martial law and blames Spider-Man for the incident, branding him a
                fugitive.

                Spider-Man gradually takes back the city, defeating Electro, Vulture, Rhino, and Scorpion. Mary Jane
                infiltrates Osborn's penthouse and learns that Oscorp developed Devil's Breath to cure Osborn's
                terminally ill son Harry.[33] As a child, Li was a test subject for the cure, gaining his abilities in
                an explosion of energy that also killed his parents and caused his hatred for Osborn. She also learns
                that an antidote for Devil's Breath exists and that Li has stolen it. Spider-Man tracks down and defeats
                Li, but Octavius arrives, brutalizes Spider-Man, and escapes with the antidote and Osborn. While
                Spider-Man recovers, Miles is bitten by an Oscorp genetically modified spider that Mary Jane unknowingly
                carried from Osborn's penthouse.[33]

                Wounded, Peter builds himself an armored suit and confronts Octavius atop Oscorp Tower, rescuing Osborn.
                Octavius reveals that he knows Peter's secret identity and a battle ensues. Spider-Man retrieves the
                antidote and defeats Octavius, leaving him to be arrested. Peter is forced to choose between using the
                limited cure to save May from her imminent death or synthesizing a vaccine for the infected masses; he
                decides to save everyone. Before she dies, May reveals that she knows he is Spider-Man and is proud of
                him.

                Three months later, New York has returned to normal, and Peter and Mary Jane rekindle their
                relationship. Miles reveals to Peter that he has gained spider-like powers, prompting Peter to reveal
                his own. Having resigned as mayor in disgrace, Osborn enters a secret laboratory where Harry is kept in
                stasis with a black, web-like substance.[c] As Osborn places his hand on the tank, the substance reacts
                and copies him.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Marvel's Spider-Man is an open-world action-adventure game set in the borough of Manhattan in a
                fictionalized version of modern-day New York City.[5][3] It is presented from a third-person perspective
                showing the playable character and allowing the camera to be rotated freely around them.[3] The primary
                playable character is the superhero Spider-Man,[6] who can navigate the world by jumping, using his web
                shooters to fire webs that allow him to swing between buildings, running along walls and automatically
                vaulting over obstacles. Webs can be precisely aimed to pull the player towards specific points.[3][4]
                Physical objects are required to attach webs to for swinging, and momentum and speed of the swing can be
                controlled by releasing the web at specific points to gain height or move more quickly.[7] The game
                features an optional fast travel system that uses the New York City Subway system.[8]

                Combat is enacted using three buttons; one for dodging, one for physical strikes, and one for web-based
                attacks.[3] Webbing can be used to incapacitate enemies and stick them to nearby objects, immediately
                removing them from battle. Enemies who are knocked from great heights are automatically stuck to a
                nearby surface in a web-cocoon, preventing death.[9][10] Spider-Man can also use the environment to
                fight, jumping off walls and throwing objects like manhole covers, grenades and webbing-restrained
                enemies.[4]

                Successful and consecutive attacks build "Focus", which can be partially used to heal Spider-Man, while
                full Focus allows special finishing attacks to take down an enemy instantly.[3][4] Spider-Man possesses
                "spider-sense", which is shown as a white icon around the character's head, indicating an incoming
                attack that can be dodged. A precise dodge performed just before the attack hits allows Spider-Man to
                retaliate with webbing against the enemy.[4] Some enemies must be overcome using different approaches.
                Melee-weapon-wielding enemies must be knocked into the air and shielded enemies must be attacked from
                behind. Enemies armed with whips will drag Spider-Man out of the air and require a counterattack to
                fight effectively. Other types of enemy include heavily armored agents who can take more damage, brutes,
                and jetpack-wearing enemies who remain airborne.[9]

                Spider-Man has access to a variety of gadgets that can be deployed in combat; these include electric
                webbing, concussive blasts, and impact webbing that launches enemies backwards and can stick them to a
                nearby surface.[10][4] Gadgets are unlocked by progressing through the game and can be accessed from a
                radial menu.[4] Spider-Man has several unlockable suits that are based on existing versions of the
                character in media; there are also original suits created for the game. Many of these offer special
                abilities that can aid in combat, such as increasing Focus gain, reducing gravity, enhancing stealth,
                making the player invulnerable, and unleashing an electromagnetic pulse to disable enemy weapons. Once
                unlocked, suits and powers can be freely combined.[3][10] Stealth combat involves Spider-Man moving
                around raised locations using gadgets or webbing to neutralize isolated enemies.[10] Leveling up allows
                the player to unlock skills from three different specialties, focusing on ground combat, aerial combat,
                and traversal.[8]

                Suits, suit mods, gadgets, and their associated upgrades are purchased with resources called Tokens,
                which are awarded for completion of specific tasks. Each unlockable item requires different quantities
                of each Token type: Challenge Tokens for completing Taskmaster's time-and-skill based combat, stealth,
                and traversal missions;[11] Backpack Tokens for locating Spider-Man's old backpacks containing mementos
                from his past;[12] Research Tokens for completing research station missions, science minigames, and the
                collection of pigeons;[13] Crime Tokens for stopping ambient crimes;[14] Base Tokens for clearing out
                enemy bases;[15] and Landmark Tokens for taking pictures of specific locations around the city.[16]
                There are also minigames that are rewarded with experience points and research tokens including Circuit
                Puzzles that require the arrangement of an electric grid and Pattern Puzzles that require the recreation
                of a specific pattern using composite parts.[17] Radio towers in different areas can be unscrambled,
                highlighting collectable objects, missions, and active crimes.
