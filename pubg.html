            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a battle royale game developed
                by PUBG Studios and published by Krafton. The game, which was inspired by the Japanese film Battle
                Royale (2000), is based on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, and
                expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. It is the first game in the PUBG
                Universe series.

                The game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective. In the game, up to one
                hundred players parachute onto an island where they scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill other
                players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in
                size over time, directing surviving players into an ever tightening space to force encounters. The last
                surviving player (or team) wins the round.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>PUBG is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale,
                a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players
                can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. The last person or
                team alive wins the match.[1]

                Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the eight maps which have different
                sizes and terrain.[2] The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players
                to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.[1] Players start with no gear
                beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay. Once they land, players can search
                buildings, ghost towns and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other equipment. These
                items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match, with certain high-risk
                zones typically having better equipment.[1] Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as
                well.[1] Players can opt to play either from the first-person or third-person perspective, each having
                their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness; though server-specific
                settings can be used to force all players into one perspective to eliminate some advantages.[3]

                Every few minutes, the playable area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random location, with
                any player caught outside the safe area taking damage incrementally, and eventually being eliminated if
                the safe zone is not entered in time; in game, the players see the boundary as a shimmering blue wall
                that contracts over time.[4] This results in a more confined map, in turn increasing the chances of
                encounters.[1] During the course of the match, random regions of the map are highlighted in red and
                bombed, posing a threat to players who remain in that area.[5] In both cases, players are warned a few
                minutes before these events, giving them time to relocate to safety.[6] A plane will fly over various
                parts of the playable map occasionally at random, or wherever a player uses a flare gun, and drop a loot
                package, containing items which are typically unobtainable during normal gameplay. These packages emit
                highly visible red smoke, drawing interested players near it and creating further confrontations.[1][7]
                On average, a full round takes no more than 30 minutes.[6]

                At the completion of each round, players gain in-game currency based on their performance. The currency
                is used to purchase crates which contain cosmetic items for character or weapon customization.[8] A
                rotating "event mode" was added to the game in March 2018. These events change up the normal game rules,
                such as establishing larger teams or squads, or altering the distribution of weapons and armor across
                the game map.
