            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>After defeating Kronika and Shang Tsung,[c] Fire God Liu Kang uses Kronika's Hourglass to recreate the
                universe before relinquishing control of it to Geras to become Earthrealm's protector. Over time, he
                forms a tenuous alliance with Outworld under the auspices of continuing the Mortal Kombat tournaments.
                In the present, a powerless Outworlder named Shang Tsung struggles to make a living selling quack
                medicine until he is approached by a mysterious individual named "Damashi", who reveals to him that he
                has the potential to become a sorcerer and that unseen forces have been working against him. Meanwhile,
                Liu Kang recruits farmhands Kung Lao and Raiden, struggling Hollywood actor Johnny Cage, and former
                yakuza gangster Kenshi Takahashi to compete in the latest tournament, with Raiden eventually being
                chosen as Earthrealm's champion and winning the tournament.

                After learning from Geras that Shang Tsung has regained his abilities and is serving as an advisor to
                Outworld's Empress Sindel, Liu Kang tasks Kenshi, Kung Lao, and Johnny with investigating Shang Tsung's
                activities. They travel to Outworld's wastelands, where they encounter Tarkatans, victims of the Tarkat
                virus outbreak, and witness Shang Tsung extracting bone marrow from the Tarkatans' leader Baraka. The
                Earthrealmers intervene, though Shang Tsung escapes to his laboratory. With Baraka's aid, the group
                locates the lab and stops Shang Tsung from seemingly infecting Outworld's crown princess, Mileena, with
                the Tarkat virus. However, Mileena attacks them, blinding Kenshi before Shang Tsung injects her with a
                serum to control her Tarkat symptoms. Her sister, Princess Kitana, and General Shao arrive to capture
                the Earthrealmers. Shang Tsung misleads them before convening with his ally and fellow sorcerer Quan
                Chi. The Earthrealmers are taken to the Flesh Pits, but escape with Reptile's help and encounter Ashrah,
                a Netherrealm demoness in search of absolution, who reveals that Quan Chi is building devices capable of
                stealing souls on a massive scale. Though Quan Chi uses several souls to create Ermac, the group defeats
                them and destroys one of the soul stealers before all except for Baraka return to Earthrealm to warn Liu
                Kang.

                Liu Kang orders Lin Kuei warriors Sub-Zero, Scorpion, and Smoke to destroy the soul stealers and capture
                Shang Tsung, but Shang Tsung sways Sub-Zero to his side by promising him access to the undead Dragon
                Army. As Scorpion and Smoke escape, Geras, upon further investigation, informs Liu Kang that "Damashi"
                hails from a parallel timeline.

                With Li Mei's help, Liu Kang returns to Outworld to provide Sindel and her daughters with evidence of
                the sorcerers' treachery and reveal his influence on the current timeline. Shao attempts to ambush the
                group, but is defeated and captured. The Earthrealmers and Outworlders team up to destroy the remaining
                soul stealers, only to be ambushed by Ermac. Mileena defeats him, allowing the soul of her father and
                Sindel's husband, Emperor Jerrod, to manifest and take control of Ermac's body. Upon confronting the
                sorcerers, they are joined by "Damashi", who is revealed to be the previous timeline's Shang Tsung. He
                reveals further that while fighting Liu Kang for the Hourglass, they fractured time, creating a separate
                timeline where he defeated Kronika and Liu Kang and became a Titan. Intending to absorb Liu Kang's
                timeline, he betrays the sorcerers and summons warriors from his own. Liu Kang's group narrowly drives
                them off, though Sindel is fatally wounded and appoints Mileena her successor before dying and having
                her soul absorbed by Jerrod.

                Forming a temporary alliance to deal with the threat, Shang Tsung hypothesizes that there are more
                timelines outside his counterpart's knowledge. Geras adds that he had stored Liu Kang's Titan powers
                should the need for them arise. As the others leave to destroy the Dragon Army, Liu Kang regains his
                Titan powers and reunites with his friends from the previous timeline to recruit forces for the upcoming
                battle. Anticipating this, Titan Shang Tsung summons an army of their evil counterparts. Following a
                grueling battle, Liu Kang's group prevails, allowing him to erase Titan Shang Tsung and his timeline
                from existence. After returning everyone he recruited to their native timelines, Liu Kang returns to his
                own to congratulate his champions over dinner before departing to assist Scorpion and Smoke in founding
                the Shirai Ryu clan and preparing Earthrealm for future conflicts.

                In a mid-credits scene, alternate timeline warriors led by Titan Havik observe the aftermath of Liu Kang
                and Titan Shang Tsung's battle. Feeling it ended too quickly, Titan Havik vows to start a new, longer
                battle.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Mortal Kombat 1 features a story mode, online multiplayer with rollback netcode, and offline gameplay, as
                well as cross-play and cross-progression, a first in the series. However, cross-play and
                cross-progression is unavailable on Nintendo Switch, but cross-play support was added on February 27,
                2024, while the King of the Hill online mode will support cross-play in the future. The game introduces
                a feature called Kameo Fighters, which provides assistance to the player during fights in a similar
                fashion to the tag assist fighters of the Towers of Time mode in Mortal Kombat 11 (2019). These
                characters are separate from the main roster and are chosen before each fight. There are two types of
                assists provided by each Kameo Fighter: Summons, which can be performed while the player remains in one
                place, and Ambushes, which can be performed regardless of what the player is doing. They can also be
                called to perform their own Fatalities and Brutalities. In addition, the chosen Kameo Fighter also
                affects how much health the players will have in a fight.[7][8]

                Fatal Blows, first introduced in Mortal Kombat 11, returns with different functionality. These special
                moves can still be triggered when a player's health drops below 30% only, however in this game, they are
                performed as collaborative offensive moves between a player and a Kameo Fighter, with each delivering an
                attack in tandem. Additionally, the most significant attack performed during the Fatal Blow features the
                X-Ray effects seen in Mortal Kombat X (2015).[9] Also returning is the Air Kombat combo system which was
                featured in both Mortal Kombat: Armageddon (2006) and the action spin-off Shaolin Monks (2005).[10]

                For single-player, the game features the return of the plot-driven Story Mode and the traditional form
                of Towers mode from the previous games, while introducing the addition of the seasonal Invasion mode, an
                online mode combining fighting mechanics with board game and role-playing game elements.[11] The players
                are tasked to move around the board while completing various challenges on each space they move to,
                earning rewards such as skins, in-game currency, or concept art for completing the challenges. Each
                Invasion season lasts around six weeks and has its own board and theme.[12] For multiplayer, the versus
                modes include Local mode to play a match on the same console, Online mode to play against opponents all
                over the world, and Tournament mode to host a tournament with a unified rule set for the matches.
