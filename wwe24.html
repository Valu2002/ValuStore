            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>WWE 2K24 is a professional wrestling sports video game developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K.
                It is the twenty-fourth overall installment of the video game series based on WWE, the tenth game under
                the WWE 2K banner, and the successor to WWE 2K23. It was released on March 8, 2024 for PlayStation 4,
                PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S.

                WWE 2K24 received generally favorable reviews upon release, with critics considering it to largely
                consist of incremental improvements and refinements over its predecessor.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="descriere">
            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Like its predecessor, WWE 2K24 features arcade and simulation wrestling gameplay. Several gimmick matches
                have returned to the franchise, such as ambulance, casket, gauntlet, and special guest referee matches.
                The "Backstage Brawl" mode was updated with a larger variety of weapons and four-player
                multiplayer.[1][2][3] New combat features include "Super Finishers"—which allows players to use all
                three of their finisher charges at once to perform a higher-powered move, the ability to dive onto
                groups of opponents, and new types of objects as weapons such as microphones and trash cans.[3][1][2]

                The 2K Showcase mode, "Showcase... of the Immortals", is themed around notable matches from the history
                of WrestleMania, including recreations of their respective venues (such as SoFi Stadium for WrestleMania
                39). It incorporates archive footage mixed into gameplay, and also features segments narrated by Cody
                Rhodes and Corey Graves.[4][1][2]

                MyGM mode is similar to 2K23, but adds additional features such as the ability to purchase permanent
                upgrades to production, scout for talent, and conduct trade offers between brands following events.
                MyUniverse was similarly updated with additional features, including more types of run-ins, and support
                for double title and loser leaves town matches.[1][3] MyRise mode on 2K24 features two campaigns, the
                men's division campaign "Undisputed", and the women's division campaign "Unleashed". In Undisputed you
                play as "The Dark Horse", the newly crowned Undisputed champion whom attempts to escape the shadow of
                Roman Reigns. In Unleashed, you play as "The Captain" an indie wrestling legend suddenly thrust into the
                WWE.[5][2]

                Development
                In May 2023, during an annual quarterly earnings call held by 2K's holding company Take-Two Interactive,
                WWE 2K24 was announced as an upcoming title set to be released in March 2024 fiscal year.[6]

                The game was officially announced on January 22, 2024, for a release on March 8 for PC, PlayStation 4,
                Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. Cody Rhodes was announced as the cover star of the
                standard edition, while The Judgment Day's Rhea Ripley and Bianca Belair were announced as the cover
                stars of the deluxe edition. A "40 Years of WrestleMania" Edition was also announced, with its cover
                featuring a collage of current and past WWE performers.
