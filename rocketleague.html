            <p>Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first
                released for PlayStation 4 and Windows in July 2015, with ports for Xbox One and Nintendo Switch being
                released later on. Rocket League was available on Steam for Windows players and the PlayStation Store
                for PlayStation 4 players. In June 2016, 505 Games began distributing a physical retail version for
                PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment taking over those duties by the
                end of 2017. Versions for macOS and Linux were also released in 2016, but support for their online
                services was dropped in 2020. Epic Games acquired Psyonix in 2019 and made the game free-to-play in
                September 2020.

                Described as "soccer, but with rocket-powered cars", Rocket League has up to eight players assigned to
                each of the two teams, using rocket-powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score
                points over the course of a match. The game includes single-player and multiplayer modes that can be
                played both locally and online, including cross-platform play between all versions. Later updates for
                the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes, including ones based on ice
                hockey and basketball.

                Rocket League is a sequel to Psyonix's Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, a 2008 video
                game for the PlayStation 3. Battle-Cars received mixed reviews and was not a success, but gained a loyal
                fan base. Psyonix continued to support themselves through contract development work for other studios
                while looking to develop a sequel. Psyonix began formal development of Rocket League around 2013,
                refining the gameplay from Battle-Cars to address criticism and fan input. Psyonix also recognized their
                lack of marketing from Battle-Cars and engaged in both social media and promotions to market the game,
                including offering the game for free for PlayStation Plus members on release.

                Rocket League was praised for its gameplay improvements over Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered
                Battle-Cars, as well as its graphics and overall presentation, although some criticism was directed
                towards the game's physics engine. It has since been considered one of the greatest video games ever
                made. The game earned many industry awards and saw over 10 million sales and 40 million players by the
                beginning of 2018. Rocket League has also been adopted as an esport, with professional players
                participating through ESL and Major League Gaming along with Psyonix's own Rocket League Championship
                Series (RLCS).

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Rocket League's gameplay is largely the same as that of its predecessor, Supersonic Acrobatic
                Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. Players control a rocket-powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much
                larger than the cars towards the other team's goal area to score goals, in a way that resembles indoor
                soccer, with elements reminiscent of a demolition derby.[1][2] Players' cars have the ability to jump to
                hit the ball while in mid-air. The players can also pick up a speed boost by passing their cars over
                marked spaces on the field, enabling them to quickly cross the field, use the added momentum to hit the
                ball, or ram into another player's car to destroy it; in the latter case, the destroyed car respawns
                moments later on their team's side of the field. A player may also use a boost when in the air to propel
                themselves forward in flight, allowing players to hit the ball in the air. Players can alter their car's
                orientation while midair, which combined with midair boosting allows for controlled flight. Players can
                also perform quick dodges, causing their car to do a short jump and spin in a given direction, which can
                be used to nudge the ball or gain positioning advantage over the other team.[3] In a recent update, the
                game introduced a new feature that allows players to view the remaining boost amount of their
                teammates.[4]

                Matches are usually five minutes long, with a sudden death overtime if the game is tied at that
                point.[5] Matches can be played from between one-on-one up to four-on-four players, as well as in casual
                and ranked playlists.[6] The latter serves as Rocket League's competitive online mode, where players
                compete in various tiered ranks within game seasons, with victories or losses raising or lowering a
                player's rank, respectively.[7] The game includes a single-player Season mode, with the player competing
                with computer-controlled players. An update in December 2016 introduced Custom Training sequences that
                can be created by players and shared with others on the same platform; players are able to specify the
                ball's path and the presence and skill of opponents on the field as to practice specific shots-on-goal
                over and over.[8]

                A few months after it was released, Psyonix released an update that added game modes known as mutators,
                modifying some aspects of gameplay, such as increased or decreased gravity, ball size, ball speed and
                bounciness.[9] For the 2015 holiday season, another update replaced mutator matches with an ice
                hockey-inspired mode (called Snow Day), played on an ice rink and the ball replaced with a hockey puck
                with different physics.[10] Positive reception to the ice hockey mode led to it being extended for a few
                weeks after the holiday season. Snow Day was permanently added to the mutator settings for private
                matches and exhibition games on February 10, 2016.[11][12] Hoops, a game mode based on
                basketball,[13][14][15] was added on April 25, 2016.[16] A separate Rumble mode, which incorporates
                unusual power-ups, such as the ability to freeze the ball in place or cause a single opponent to have
                difficulty controlling their car, was added on September 8, 2016.[17] An update in December 2016, known
                as Starbase ARC and based on Psyonix' mobile game ARC Squadron,[18] added support for custom arenas for
                Windows players supported through Steam Workshop, along with other new content.[19] In celebration of
                Super Bowl LV in February 2021, Psyonix released a limited time gamemode called Gridiron, which
                functions similar to gridiron football with the normal soccer ball being replaced by a football.
