            <p>The Crew Motorfest is an online-only 2023 racing video game developed by Ubisoft Ivory Tower and
                published by Ubisoft for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. It is the
                sequel to 2018's The Crew 2 and the third game in The Crew series, and was released on September 14,
                2023. The game is set in an open world environment; a scaled-down version of the Hawaiian islands of
                Oʻahu and later included Maui. It received generally positive reviews from critics and is considered an
                improvement over its predecessors.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>The Crew Motorfest is set in a scaled-down version of the island of Oʻahu in Hawaii.[2][3] It is themed
                around a festival that will serve as the main area for accessing the various events in the game, which
                is similar to that of the Forza Horizon series of games.[4][5] Its gameplay is similar to that of the
                previous games in the series, featuring online multiplayer features referred to in game as a "crew", as
                well as being able to control vehicles other than cars such as planes and boats.[6]

                The main part of the game is "Playlists", which consist of a series of staged events, side activities,
                and challenges. As of September 2023, there are fifteen playlists, each with a different theme such as
                vintage cars, Lamborghini and collaborations with influencers such as Supercar Blondie, Liberty Walk
                [ja] and Donut Media.

                Multiplayer modes include the "Grand Race" and "Demolition Royale". The Grand Race a long race that is
                approximately 10 minutes long with 28 players online split up into three sections for three tiers of
                racing. The sections and tiers for each race is chosen by random and swaps every 30 minutes, while the
                race route is random for every race. Demolition Royale is the game's demolition derby-based battle
                royale mode, where up to 32 players are put into crews with the main goal of driving their
                demolition-type vehicles to destroy the racers of other crews in a shrinking safe area. Power-ups spawn
                in the safe area to give racers an advantage, such as shields and health. The Demolition Royale ends
                when only one crew still has at least one racer remaining.

                The Main Stage, the game's live-service mode, consists of a monthly theme with unique limited-time
                rewards. Each week of each month, players earn experience to fill up the Revisit, Racing, and Explore
                timelines to earn rewards. After filing up one of the Main Stage timelines, the player unlocks the
                "Legend" timeline, filled with its own set of limited-time rewards.

                Every week, a sub-theme of the main stage theme will be used for the "Summit Contest", a weekly themed
                contest where players compete in nine challenges—six races and three feats—to earn points for a tiered
                ranking of Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. The top 10,000 players with the most points—the
                Platinum-tiered players—can receive an exclusive prize, including limited-time Summit-exclusive vehicles
                or titles to display on the name of the player in-game, and the person in first position for each week
                will have their player name carved into a star for all players to see in Festival Tent, where every
                player loads into when starting a session in the game.

                The "Custom Show" is a weekly contest where players can customize their vehicle to the weekly "Summit
                Contest" theme and let players vote for which vehicle they like. At the end of the week, the players
                with the most votes get rewards.

                Much like its two predecessors, The Crew Motorfest requires a constant internet connection to play.
