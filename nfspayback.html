            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Tyler "Ty" Morgan (Jack Derges), Sean "Mac" McAlister (David Ajala), Jessica "Jess" Miller (Jessica
                Madsen) and mechanic Ravindra "Rav" Chaudhry (Ramon Tikaram) are part of a crew in Silver Rock, Fortune
                Valley. Fixer Lina Navarro (Dominique Tipper) tasks them with stealing a precious Koenigsegg Regera
                belonging to Marcus "The Gambler" Weir. However, as Tyler arrives at the drop point, he finds Rav
                knocked out. Lina appears, revealing that she set up Tyler and his crew to take the fall for the stolen
                car and she drives away, leaving them at the mercy of the oncoming police force. Upon learning that Lina
                betrayed both of them, Weir initially considers leaving Tyler to be arrested, but instead protects
                Tyler, planning their revenge.

                Six months later, working as a valet for Weir, Tyler spots Lina threatening Weir to hand over the casino
                to The House, a cartel who controls Fortune Valley's underworld. Frustrated at the lack of progress, he
                decides to take matters into his own hands. Contacting The House as a racer, he enters a race and wins
                it, despite Lina having rigged the race for profit. Weir proposes Tyler a way to take down The House and
                Lina along with it. Tyler is to enter and win "The Outlaw's Rush", a massive street racing event that
                has the nation's top racers participating, which The House plans to rig for their own ends. Following
                the destruction of his home caused by Lina for ignoring her order during the fixed race, Tyler
                reassembles his old crew and they successfully defeat all rivaling racing leagues and are thus allowed
                to enter "The Outlaw's Rush". Simultaneously, Jess infiltrates the House and learns of their plans to
                take over the entire city.

                At "The Outlaw's Rush", Tyler manages to win both the street and the offroad event with the help of all
                the race crews they allied with during the game, and in the end, defeats Navarro herself. Thus, Navarro
                and "The Collector" are defeated and the House's hold over Silver Rock is broken.

                In a post-credits scene, Mr. Kobashi, a customer whom Jess had driven, calls Weir and tells him his
                gamble worked, and that "The Collector" is finished. He welcomes Weir to Arkwright, the true power
                behind the House.

                Development
                In January 2016, Ghost Games began development on the next Need for Speed game to be released in
                2017.[5] Electronic Arts later confirmed in their January 2017 earnings call that the next game in the
                franchise was in development and set to be launched during EA's fiscal year 2018 (comprising from April
                2017 to March 2018).</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Need for Speed Payback is a racing game set in an open world environment of Fortune Valley; a fictional
                version of Las Vegas, Nevada. It is focused on "action driving" and has three playable characters (each
                with different sets of skills) working together to pull off action movie-like sequences. In contrast
                with the previous game, it also features a 24-hour day-night cycle.[2] Unlike the 2015 Need for Speed
                reboot, Payback includes an offline single-player mode.[3]

                Payback features a total of 74 vehicles with downloadable contents. Toyota, Scion and Ferrari are not
                involved in the game due to licensing issues. However, the Subaru BRZ appears in the game.[4] Aston
                Martin, Audi, Buick, Jaguar, Koenigsegg, Land Rover, Mercury, Pagani, and Plymouth make their return
                after their absence from the 2015 installment, while Alfa Romeo, Infiniti, Mini and Pontiac were added
                via downloadable content.
