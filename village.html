            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Three years after Resident Evil 7, Ethan and Mia have been relocated to Europe by Chris Redfield to start
                a new life with their newborn daughter Rosemary. One night, Chris and his Hound Wolf squad raid the
                house, assassinate Mia, and abduct Ethan and Rosemary. Ethan awakens next to a crashed transport truck
                in which he was riding, and discovers a village terrorized by werewolf-like creatures called Lycans.
                Ethan fails to save the remaining villagers and is captured by Karl Heisenberg and brought before the
                village priestess Mother Miranda and her lords: Alcina Dimitrescu, Donna Beneviento, Salvatore Moreau,
                and Heisenberg himself. Ethan escapes a death trap made by Heisenberg and ventures into Dimitrescu's
                castle to find Rosemary, with help from a mysterious merchant known as the Duke. Ethan eliminates
                Dimitrescu and her daughters, finding a flask containing Rosemary's head. The Duke explains that Miranda
                placed Rosemary's body parts in four different flasks for a special rite, and that she can be restored
                if Ethan recovers the other flasks, held by the remaining lords.

                While killing Beneviento and Moreau for their flasks, Ethan learns Hound Wolf is also in the village.
                Ethan passes a test from Heisenberg for the fourth flask and is invited to the lord's factory, where
                Heisenberg proposes they defeat Miranda together. Ethan refuses, once he learns Heisenberg intends to
                weaponize Rosemary, and escapes. Ethan encounters and confronts Chris over Mia's death, learning the
                "Mia" Chris killed was Miranda in disguise. Chris reveals that Miranda possesses the power of mimicry
                and was attempting to abduct Rosemary, succeeding when she crashed the transport truck. Chris destroys
                Heisenberg's factory while Ethan uses a makeshift tank to kill Heisenberg. After the battle, Miranda
                shows herself and mocks Ethan, revealing her plans to take Rosemary as her own. She then rips his heart
                out, killing him.

                Witnessing Ethan's death, Chris leads Hound Wolf to extract Rosemary while a Bioterrorism Security
                Assessment Alliance (BSAA) assault force distracts Miranda. Chris enters a cave beneath the village and
                discovers the Megamycete,[b] the source of the mold. He plants a bomb on the Megamycete and finds
                Miranda's lab, learning that she has lived a century since coming into contact with the fungus, and was
                a mentor to the Umbrella Corporation's founder Oswell E. Spencer; Oswell used her knowledge to develop
                the T-Virus. Miranda experimented with the fungus in an attempt to revive her daughter, Eva, who had
                succumbed to the Spanish flu; the four lords, Lycans, and Eveline were failed experiments. Rosemary,
                however, is a suitable host, due to her special abilities inherited from Ethan and Mia. Chris rescues
                the imprisoned Mia, who reveals that Ethan should still be alive, due to his powers.

                Ethan revives after encountering Eveline in limbo, who reveals that he was already killed in his first
                encounter with Jack Baker in Dulvey, but was revived by her mold, which gave him regenerative powers.
                The Duke brings Ethan to the ritual site where Miranda attempts to revive Eva, but ends up reviving
                Rosemary instead. Enraged, she battles Ethan, who kills her, before the Megamycete emerges from the
                ground. Ethan, with his regenerative powers finally having reached their limit, sacrifices himself to
                detonate the bomb planted on the Megamycete, while Chris transports Mia and Rosemary to safety. As Mia
                mourns the loss of Ethan, Chris discovers that the BSAA soldiers sent to the village were organic
                bioweapons and orders his squad to head for the BSAA's European headquarters.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Like its predecessor, Resident Evil 7: Biohazard, Resident Evil Village uses a first-person perspective,
                and has the option for a third-person perspective. It is set in a snowy explorable European village,
                described as "pulled straight from the Victorian era" and much larger and more immersive than its
                predecessor.[1] Structures and buildings in the central village can be climbed and used to fight
                enemies.[1] Compared to Biohazard, the game is more action focused, with protagonist Ethan Winters
                equipped with more combat skills due to military training.[2] The game's primary enemies, the
                werewolf-like Lycans, are agile and intelligent and can wield weapons and attack in packs, forcing the
                player to rethink their strategy on whether to use sparse ammunition, use melee combat, or run
                away.[3][4][5] Similar to Resident Evil 4 (2005), makeshift barricades can be used to fend off
                enemies.[4]

                The inventory management mechanic is similar to that of Resident Evil 4, featuring a briefcase and the
                ability to move and rotate items for better storage space. Players can buy supplies, weapons, upgrades,
                and items from a merchant called the Duke.[6] The players can hunt animals in the village and have them
                cooked into dishes by the Duke. Eating side dishes allows the player to gain certain advantages such as
                decreasing the damage taken while blocking.[7] Treasures and collectibles can be found around the
                village, and sold to the Duke for currency.[1]

                Players can manually save the game progress by locating and using typewriters, which replaces the tape
                recorders in Resident Evil 7 and marks their first appearance in a mainline game since Resident Evil
                4.[8] A map of the village can be accessed from the pause menu, as well as a diary with sketches
                recapping the player's progress in the story so far.[4] Two features added to the game were photo mode,
                which allow to screenshot in-game moments, and a button to skip cutscenes.[9]

                The Mercenaries Mode, an arcade-style game mode of past Resident Evil games, returns in Village. In this
                mode, players fight through timed stages, and purchase items and upgrades from the Duke's Emporium.[10]
                Players who purchased Village also received Resident Evil Re:Verse, a six-player online multiplayer
                third-person shooter. After nearly a year and half delay, Re:Verse was activated in October 2022.
