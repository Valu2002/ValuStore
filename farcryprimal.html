            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Takkar, a hunter from the Wenja tribe, is the only survivor after his hunting party is ambushed and
                killed by a sabertooth, cutting him off from the rest of his kin. Resigned to proceed alone, Takkar
                meets Sayla (Cara Ricketts), a Wenja gatherer whose life he saves, and once they arrive at Oros, Sayla
                informs Takkar that the Wenja are scattered and homeless across the land after their village was
                destroyed by Ull (DeLaRosa Rivera), leader of the Neanderthal-like Udam tribe who live in the northern
                mountains, prize warfare and hunting, and frequently kidnap Wenja to cannibalize them. Takkar then
                starts gathering the Wenja he meets around his cave, eventually encountering the wolf shaman Tensay
                (Terrence C. Carson), who helps him to learn the ability to tame the local animals. Tensay dubs Takkar
                the "Beast Master" for his skill.

                After repelling an Udam attack led by Ull on his newly established village, Takkar enlists the help of
                three other skilled Wenja: Jayma (Ayisha Issa), a veteran huntress, Wogah (Ron Kennell), a one-armed
                craftsman, and Karoosh (Nicolas Van Burek), a one-eyed warrior with his own vendetta against the Udam.
                With the help of Tensay, Takkar discovers that the Udam are eating Wenja flesh in hopes of gaining
                immunity from a terminal genetic disease, the "skull fire", that is wiping out their tribe, then tracks
                down and apprehends the Udam commander Dah (Juan Carlos Velis) to learn more about the Udam's
                techniques. Several Wenja reject Takkar's decision to give shelter to an Udam warrior at first, and take
                him to a cave to be executed by drowning, until Takkar himself arrives in time to rescue Dah and
                chastise the tribe for disobeying him, earning Dah's gratitude and help. When the agrarian, ritualistic
                Izila, another, more advanced tribe that lives in the marshlands of southern Oros, begin capturing Wenja
                prisoners for slavery and human sacrifice to the Sun goddess Suxli, Takkar invades their domains to
                rescue them, coming face to face with their leader Batari (Debra Wilson). After he refuses to become
                Batari's slave, a war begins between the Wenja and Izila. Takkar then infiltrates the camp of an Izila
                commander named Roshani (Ali Momen) and captures him, allowing him to live in exchange for sharing Izila
                technology in both warfare and agriculture.

                After preparing himself enough to face Ull and Batari, Takkar storms the Udam and Izila's main
                fortresses, passing by all opposition before confronting and killing their commanders. While the defiant
                Batari is burned alive during a solar eclipse, Ull urges Takkar to take care of his two children with
                his dying breath, which Takkar accepts, taking them with him back to his village. With both rival tribes
                defeated and Wenja dominance secured, Roshani agrees to stay with the Wenja and teach them how to grow
                food, while Takkar reluctantly agrees to mercifully kill Dah, ending his suffering from disease. Takkar
                then joins Sayla and Tensay in a celebration of his victory with the other villagers.

                In the post-credits, Ull's daughter appears taming a cave bear, implying that she has acquired Takkar's
                animal taming skills.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Far Cry Primal is an action-adventure game set in an open world environment and played from a
                first-person perspective. As the game is set in prehistoric times, the traditional gunplay and vehicle
                gameplay featured in the Far Cry series were removed,[2] and the player can only get access to melee
                weapons such as spears, clubs and ranged weapons such as bows and slings.[3] The player cannot purchase
                weapons and must craft them using the materials scavenged in the world such as wood and stone. As the
                player progresses, they can craft more lethal weapons with a larger variety of resources.[citation
                needed]

                Besides facing natural dangers, the player must also compete with other hostile tribes occupying the
                area. By attacking and seizing bonfires and camps, the Wenja tribe will move in and begin patrolling the
                nearby region, and the player will gain fast travel points as well as camps to rest in. Non-player
                characters will also task the player to rescue tribe-mates and perform other tasks which improve the
                village, as well as provide free crafting materials. The game also features a dynamic weather system and
                day-night cycle, which affects the gameplay.[4] At night, more predators are present, and many become
                more aggressive and dangerous, whereas at the day, the player can gather food and scavenge other
                resources such as tools for hunting. The player can also make use of fire as a tool for personal
                protection or hunting at night.[3][5]

                The player can bait different wildlife in the game using lures, and can also tame predators while
                they're feeding on the bait. These animals serve as a companion for the player and can assist them in
                combating enemies after being tamed, and can be summoned remotely and issued basic commands. Larger
                animals such as sabertooth cats can be used as mounts. Takkar has an owl, his spirit animal which can be
                directly controlled. Through the owl's vision, the player can scout enemies' outposts and highlight
                enemies. Through skill improvements, the owl can be upgraded to have various abilities added, such as
                diving to kill an enemy[6] or dropping bombs.

                In a post-launch update, a survival mode, which drastically increases the game's difficulty, was
                introduced.
