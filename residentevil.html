            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>In 2004, U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham
                (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President's daughter, who has been abducted by a mysterious cult.[11] He
                travels to an unnamed rural village in Spain,[12] where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who
                pledge their lives to Los Iluminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple
                farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.[13]

                While in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas.[14]
                He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former police officer in Madrid, and
                former Los Iluminados researcher.[15] The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways.
                Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her.[16] They both escape from the church
                after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Iluminados, reveals his plan to use the parasite
                they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a
                "sample" once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.[17]

                After killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Iluminados
                under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler's henchmen who owns the castle,[14]
                and the two become separated by Salazar's traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon
                and Ashley's infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed
                by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon's hands.[18]
                While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports
                him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.[19]

                Afterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley.
                He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have
                been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping in an attempt to
                get close enough to Saddler to steal his new Plagas sample.[20] Ada and Krauser are working with Albert
                Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample, though Krauser is suspicious of
                Ada.[21] Suspicious of the mercenary's intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that
                no matter which one dies, he will benefit.[22] After Krauser's defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they
                remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler,
                and with Ada's help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before
                escaping in a helicopter,[23] leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island
                explodes.[24] </p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>The player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing
                significantly from the series' previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer
                survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view
                when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle.[2] There is no crosshair
                for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only
                shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies
                to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down
                projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.[3]
                Resident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the
                environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a "finishing
                move" on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons
                indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay
                alive. These are often incorporated into the game's many boss fights, in which the player must avoid
                instant-kill attacks.[4]

                The main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados ("The Cattle" in Spanish). Unlike the
                franchise's traditional zombies, Los Ganados can dodge, wield weaponry like chainsaws and projectile
                weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other. The villagers'
                leaders may transform into grotesque monstrous forms to do battle with the player when encountered.
                Other prominent enemies include the "Regeneradors", a type of mutated humanoid creature with potent
                regenerative abilities; the troll-like El Gigante; and the gigantic sea creature Del Lago.[5]

                The inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up
                a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons,
                ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate
                menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first
                aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The
                various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.[6][7]

                Capcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii
                releases. The largest addition is "Separate Ways", a side story which focuses on Ada Wong's involvement
                in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series' villain Albert Wesker.[8] "Ada's Report", a
                five-part documentary, analyzes Ada's relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot.[9] Other
                unlockable content in all versions includes the minigame "The Mercenaries" and short scenario
                "Assignment Ada" (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new
                weapons, and a cutscene browser.[10]</p>
