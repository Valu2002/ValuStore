            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>After the death of his mother Ishwari, Ajay Ghale (James A. Woods) returns to his home country of Kyrat
                to carry out Ishwari's final wish by returning her ashes to Lakshmana. However, his mission is
                interrupted when the bus he is traveling on is attacked by the Royal Army and he is greeted by Pagan Min
                (Troy Baker), the country's eccentric and violent king. Min apologizes, brutally kills a soldier for
                shooting the bus, and acts warmly toward Ajay before kidnapping him and his tour guide and taking them
                to a dinner party at Lieutenant Paul De Pleur's mansion. After his guide is taken to be interrogated,
                Ajay flees with the aid of Sabal (Naveen Andrews), a commander in the Golden Path, a rebel movement
                established by Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale. Ajay is not able to leave the country as the Royal Army has
                taken control of Kyrat's only airport and sealed the borders.
                In the twenty-odd years since Ishwari and Ajay fled Kyrat, the rebellion has stagnated, with the Golden
                Path now fighting for their very existence. As the son of Mohan Ghale, Ajay becomes a symbol for the
                Golden Path to rally around. After freeing a group of hostages and liberating territory held by Pagan,
                the Golden Path plan on breaking Pagan's stranglehold on power by targeting his three regional
                governors: Paul "De Pleur" Harmon (Travis Willingham), who oversees opium production and runs Pagan's
                torture chambers; Noore Najjar (Mylène Dinh-Robic), who runs poaching and prostitution rings and who
                became a victim of Pagan's cruelty herself after he kidnapped her family; and Yuma Lau (Gwendoline Yeo),
                Min's adopted sister and trusted general who is obsessed with uncovering the secrets of the mystical
                realm of Shangri-La.

                However, the Golden Path's newfound momentum is threatened by deep divisions between its commanders,
                Sabal, who favors traditional values, and Amita (Janina Gavankar), who argues for progress, which
                includes relying heavily on producing drugs for export. Ajay is forced to intervene on several
                occasions, with his decisions influencing the direction the Golden Path takes. The first governor to
                fall is De Pleur, after Noore helps Ajay find a way to infiltrate De Pleur's stronghold, allowing the
                rebellion to capture him. Amita and Sabal later task Ajay with confronting and killing Noore. She dies
                in her fighting arena, either with Ajay killing her, or with Noore committing suicide upon learning
                Pagan had her family executed years beforehand.

                As the Golden Path secures Kyrat's southern provinces, Ajay is contacted by Willis Huntley (Alain
                Goulem), a CIA agent who offers intelligence for the rebels and pages from his father's diary in
                exchange for killing Yuma's lieutenants. After Ajay kills several of them, Huntley admits they were in
                fact CIA assets, and that he was sent to clean up after the CIA as the agency did not see Pagan as a
                threat anymore. Huntley betrays Ajay to Pagan just as the Golden Path prepares to push into Northern
                Kyrat.

                Ajay ends up in Yuma's mountain prison, where he is drugged and suffers terrifying hallucinations, but
                manages to escape. In the process, he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because
                of his affection toward Ajay's late mother.[b] The Golden Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay
                attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him,
                betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions
                between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will
                lead the Golden Path. Whichever leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other to prevent them from
                starting another civil war, and Ajay can choose to either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the
                Golden Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and
                pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Far Cry 4 is a first-person action-adventure game. Players assume control of Ajay Ghale, a
                Kyrati-American who is on a quest to spread his deceased mother's ashes in the fictional country of
                Kyrat. Ajay may utilize various short and long-range firearms, including pistols, revolvers, shotguns,
                assault rifles, submachine guns, bows, a flamethrower, rocket launchers, grenade launchers, and sniper
                rifles. More powerful versions of these weapons become available after considerable progress through the
                game. Throwable weapons include fragmentation grenades, Molotov cocktails, and throwing knives.[2] The
                game allows players to take cover to avoid gunfights and to perform melee takedowns from above or
                up-close.[3] Unlike previous installments in the series, Far Cry 4 gives players the ability to kick
                objects and the ability to hide the corpses of enemies. Players can use a variety of methods to approach
                missions. For instance, players can utilize stealth to evade enemies and complete objectives without
                being noticed, or they also have the option to assault enemies with firearms and vehicles. The player
                character is equipped with a digital camera, which allows him to mark and highlight all visible enemies,
                animals, and loot. Players are also able to ride on elephants,[5] which serve as tank-like offensive
                weapons.[6] Players can throw bait towards enemies, which attracts nearby wildlife that is hostile to
                both the player and enemies. Players can also hunt and skin animals.[7]

                The game features an open world environment that is free for players to explore. It features several
                environments, including forests, rivers, and mountains.[8] To allow players to travel between places
                faster, the game features various vehicles, including buggies, trucks, and water vehicles like
                speedboats. Players can drive and shoot at the same time and can enable auto-drive, in which the game's
                artificial intelligence takes over the role of controlling the vehicle and guides players to their
                objectives.[9] Players can also hijack other vehicles while driving. The Buzzer, an aerial,
                gyrocopter-like vehicle, is introduced in the game, allowing players to gain a tactical advantage from
                the air.[10] Parachutes, wingsuits, and grappling hooks are also featured in the game; these items help
                players swing across cliffs and quickly navigate the environment.[11] Parts of the game take place in
                Shangri-La, a mystical dreamland where players battle demons as the Kyrati warrior Kalinag. While in
                Shangri-La, players are accompanied by an injured tiger which serves as their companion. Players can
                issue commands to the tiger, which assists them in battle.[12][13]

                The game world is divided into two halves: North and South Kyrat. Players start in South Kyrat and are
                free to explore it almost immediately, but can only unlock North Kyrat over the course of the story. The
                map is progressively opened by liberating bell towers, freeing them from Pagan Min's influence and
                allowing the Golden Path to expand. These towers help players reveal new areas and mark new locations of
                interest on the map.[14] The world is scattered with outposts controlled by Pagan Min, which can be
                infiltrated by players. Four larger outposts, or fortresses, can also be found, and feature stronger
                defenses and more difficult combinations of enemies. If players successfully liberate these outposts,
                they will serve as fast-travel points, allowing quick navigation through the game's world. Additional
                missions and quests also become available.[15] There are many side-missions that can be completed,
                including hostage rescues, bomb disposal quests, and hunting missions. The collected animals' parts can
                then be used for crafting new pouches and belts.[16][17]

                Like its predecessors, the game features some role-playing elements. Players can earn experience points
                by completing missions and defeating enemies, and these experience points can then be spent on
                performance boosts and upgrades. There are two sets of abilities for players to choose from, called The
                Tiger and The Elephant. The Tiger upgrades mainly improve players' offensive abilities, while The
                Elephant upgrades improve players' defensive skills. A variety of random events and hostile encounters
                take place throughout the game; for example, the player may unexpectedly be attacked by an eagle, be hit
                by a car, or witness an animal attack. Players can accumulate karma by performing kind actions towards
                the rebels, such as by assisting them in battles when they are attacked by wildlife or enemies. Doing so
                will give players discounts when purchasing new items at trading posts, and will allow players to call
                in support and back-up from members of the Golden Path.[7][18] Players can also gain experience by
                collecting items like masks, propaganda posters, and prayer wheels.[14] There is also an Arena mode, in
                which players battle human enemies and animals for additional experience points and rewards.
