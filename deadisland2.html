            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>About 15 years after the events of "Dead Island",[12] the US military is forced to put Los Angeles under
                a full quarantine restricted zone due to a new and stronger zombie outbreak.

                As Los Angeles is being quarantined, six individuals (dubbed "Slayers") board one of the last evacuation
                flights out of the city: hustler Bruno, mechanic Carla, retail worker Dani, firefighter-themed stripper
                Ryan, athlete Amy, and stuntman Jacob.

                In the confusion, an infected person ends up on board, and the military shoots the plane down. The
                Slayers narrowly survive the crash but are bitten trying to help some other survivors. They manage to
                make their way to the home of one of the crash survivors, actress Emma Jaunt, who reluctantly shelters
                them despite their infection. Sam B, Emma's ex-boyfriend, arrives at the mansion intending to get Emma
                out of the city, and, revealing he is immune to the infection, the Slayers realize they are also immune.
                With the Slayers still intent on escaping the city, they head to the nearest evacuation center at the
                Halperin Hotel, only to find it overrun with infected. They recover a radio and contact Dr. Reuben Reed,
                a CDC doctor who asks them to come to his safe haven in Santa Monica to use their immunity to synthesize
                a cure. Sam warns the Slayers not to trust Reed.

                The Slayers head through the sewers to get to Santa Monica, discovering that the zombie corpses the
                military have been dumping into the sewers have melded together into a massive, tumor-like growth
                spreading underneath the city. They are stopped by another group of survivors led by Lola Konradt, who
                drops the Slayers into a pit full of zombies, temporarily triggering a bestial rage in them, which they
                use to kill all the zombies. The Slayers manage to reach Reed's haven at the Serling Hotel, where he
                informs them that the military will not extract them unless they provide proof of immunity, which means
                using Reed's testing equipment at the overrun CDC HQ. The Slayers recover the equipment and return to
                discover that Reed and Konradt are acquaintances. The Slayers are then sent to find Reed's missing
                daughter, Tisha, who is working with a team of hackers investigating mysterious encrypted data being
                exchanged by the CDC. Tisha gives the Slayers a way to contact Konradt directly in return for them
                giving her more time to investigate the CDC.

                Konradt tips the Slayers off about a secret lab where Reed sent other immune subjects. While fighting an
                infected test subject, the Slayers succumb to their feral instincts and attack Tisha, who apparently
                kills them, only to be revived by Konradt. She explains that she, her followers, and the Slayers are a
                new species of humans dubbed "Numen," who can assimilate the infection, called the Autophage, while
                retaining their minds, gaining extraordinary abilities such as increased strength, speed, or the ability
                to enter into a rage of fury, and a telepathic hive mind with other Numen. Before leaving, she warns the
                Slayers that Reed is not actually searching for a cure. The Slayers return to the Serling Hotel to
                confront Reed, only to find that he has fled with Tisha to a lab on Hollywood Boulevard and that he was
                responsible for the city-wide Autophage outbreak.

                Furious at constantly being lied to, the Slayers gather Emma, Sam, and helicopter pilot Patton,
                intending to steal Reed's helicopter and leave the city. They reach Hollywood Boulevard, where Sam
                starts succumbing to the Autophage, his immunity deteriorating. The Slayers go on ahead and confront
                Reed, who admits that he released the Autophage in the city in order to filter out Numen, explaining
                that the Autophage is not a plague but a "clock" fundamental to the human genome that is hard-coded to
                wipe them all out and turn them into zombies at a predetermined time, but also turn 1 in every million
                Humans into Numen. The Numen, who he considers either anomalies or "puppets" of the Autophage, and their
                "god blood" were his only way to find a method to neutralize it, which is why, according to his
                journals, he used a retro-virus carrier of the original Pathogen HK to spoof the zero-clock state on a
                smaller scale to create the outbreak and Numen. He gives the Slayers a single dose of Autophage cure and
                reveals that Tisha also carries the remedy in her body as he secretly injected her with Numen blood
                prior to birth to harvest the cure for the rest of her life. Reed succumbs to the Autophage, forcing the
                Slayers to kill him while Tisha flees.

                The Slayers return to Sam, Emma, and Patton and administer the cure to the former, saving his life. The
                Slayers decide to stay behind to find Tisha and help the other survivors trapped in the city. As Emma,
                Sam, and Patton escape Los Angeles, Konradt and her followers watch over the Slayers as they fight
                another horde of zombies.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Like its predecessor, it is an action role-playing game played from a first-person perspective. Dead
                Island 2 takes place in Los Angeles in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. At the beginning of the game,
                players have to select from one of six playable characters as their player avatar called a slayer. Each
                of them has their own unique skills and abilities.[4] They also have to choose from one of two defensive
                abilities, either learning to block hostile attacks, or dodge them.[5] The game's world is divided into
                10 different zones. While the player can freely explore each zone, they must travel between different
                zones through Zone Exits. As the player progresses in the game, they will also unlock fast travel
                points, allowing them to travel to different locations quickly.[6]

                Players can pick up both ranged and melee weapons. Each weapon can be further customized with mods,
                which add elemental effects, and perks, which can alter the player's stat.[7] The game features a system
                named "FLESH", which stands for "Fully Locational Evisceration System for Humanoids". It is a
                procedurally generated dismemberment system which can create weapon-appropriate wounds on zombies,
                allowing players to break their skin, bones and internal organs.[8] Weapons are divided into different
                rarity, with Rare and Superior weapons being generally more powerful.[5] In addition, players can use
                the environment to their advantage. For instance, an electric weapon can be thrown into a puddle,
                electrocuting all enemies standing on it.[9] Weapons will gradually degrade and eventually break, though
                players can repair them at workbenches found in the game's world.[10]

                Unlike previous games in the series, Dead Island 2 does not have a skill tree. Instead, it uses a
                deck-building system which allows players to alter their character's strengths and weaknesses. The Skill
                Deck sorts cards into four different categories: Abilities, Survivor, Slayer, and Numen. Abilities cards
                unlock new active abilities for players, some of which can be used during the Fury mode, which allows
                players to unleash devastating attacks on enemies for a brief period of time; Survival cards boost the
                player's health and stamina; Slayer cards grant players passive perks that enhance their combat
                abilities; Numen cards unlock special abilities that have a large damage output. Players can also equip
                "Autophage" cards. While these cards will provide perks to the player, they will also debuff them,
                making them weaker. Cards can be earned through completing quests, levelling up, and killing special
                enemies.[11]</p>
