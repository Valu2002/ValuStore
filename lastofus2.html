            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Joel (Troy Baker) confesses to his brother, Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce), his responsibility in preventing the
                Fireflies attempting to develop a cure for the Cordyceps fungus pandemic by saving Ellie (Ashley
                Johnson) from a fatal operation. Four years later, Joel and Ellie have built a life in Jackson, Wyoming,
                though their relationship has become strained. While on patrol, Joel and Tommy rescue a stranger, Abby
                (Laura Bailey), from an Infected horde. They return to an outpost used as a temporary hideout by Abby's
                group, former Fireflies now part of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF), a militia group based in
                Seattle, Washington. The group attack Joel and Tommy; Abby seeks revenge against Joel for murdering her
                father, the Firefly surgeon (Derek Phillips) who was to perform the operation on Ellie. Meanwhile, Ellie
                and her girlfriend, Dina (Shannon Woodward), search for the brothers. Ellie enters the WLF outpost and
                witnesses Abby beat Joel to death. Abby spares Ellie and Tommy, who swear revenge.

                Tommy sets out for Seattle to hunt Abby, and Ellie and Dina follow him. In Seattle, Ellie reveals her
                immunity to Dina, who in turn reveals she is pregnant. The next day, Ellie pursues Tommy alone and
                encounters Jesse (Stephen Chang), Dina's ex-boyfriend, who followed them. While searching for Abby's
                friend Nora (Chelsea Tavares), Ellie encounters the Seraphites, a religious cult locked in a battle with
                the WLF over control of Seattle. Ellie tracks down Nora and tortures her for information on Abby's
                location, which traumatizes Ellie. The following day, she kills two more members of Abby's group, the
                pregnant Mel (Ashly Burch) and her boyfriend, Owen (Patrick Fugit). A flashback reveals that, two years
                earlier, Ellie traveled to the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City and learned the truth. Devastated, she
                cut ties with Joel. In the present, Ellie's group is ambushed by Abby, who kills Jesse and holds Tommy
                hostage.

                Three days earlier, Abby learns that Owen, her ex-boyfriend, has gone missing while investigating
                Seraphite activity. Abby searches for Owen and is captured by Seraphites. She is rescued by Yara
                (Victoria Grace) and Lev (Ian Alexander), Seraphite siblings who have been branded apostates after Lev
                defied Seraphite traditions. Though Yara suffers a broken arm, Abby leaves them to find Owen who,
                disillusioned with the war, plans to sail to Santa Barbara, California, where Fireflies may be
                regrouping. Abby returns to rescue Yara and Lev, and travels across Seattle with Lev to retrieve medical
                supplies so Mel can amputate Yara's arm. After the surgery, Lev runs away to convince his devout mother
                to leave the Seraphite cult. Abby and Yara find him in the Seraphite settlement, where Lev has
                accidentally killed his mother in self-defense. The trio flee as the WLF begins an assault on the
                Seraphites. Abby betrays the WLF to save Lev, and Yara sacrifices herself to allow Abby and Lev to
                escape. The pair return to find Owen and Mel dead and a map leading to Ellie's hideout. An enraged Abby
                shoots Tommy, impairing him, and severely beats Ellie and Dina. At Lev's insistence, Abby spares them
                and tells them to leave Seattle.

                Several months later,[17] Ellie and Dina are living on a farm, raising Dina and Jesse's son, though
                Ellie suffers from post-traumatic stress. When Tommy arrives with information on Abby's whereabouts,
                Ellie leaves to find her, despite Dina's pleas to stay. Abby and Lev arrive in Santa Barbara searching
                for the Fireflies, who they discover are regrouping at Catalina Island, California, but are captured,
                tortured, and left to die by the slave-keeping Rattlers. Ellie arrives at Santa Barbara and rescues the
                pair. Ellie forces Abby to fight her, during which Abby bites off two of Ellie's fingers. Ellie
                overpowers and nearly drowns Abby, but has a change of heart after having a flashback of Joel, and
                ultimately spares her. Abby and Lev sail to the Fireflies. Ellie returns to the farmhouse and finds it
                empty. She tries to play Joel's guitar with her damaged hand, recalls her last conversation with Joel in
                which she expressed her willingness to forgive him, and leaves.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>The Last of Us Part II is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective featuring
                elements of the survival horror genre.[1][2] The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as
                buildings and forests to advance the story. The player can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth
                to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the
                Cordyceps fungus.[3] Control intermittently switches between Ellie and Abby;[1] the player also briefly
                controls Joel in the opening sequence.[4] The nimble nature of the player character introduces
                platforming elements, allowing the player to jump and climb to traverse environments and gain advantages
                during combat.[5] The player can break glass objects such as windows to access certain areas or obtain
                supplies.[6] Some areas are navigated by horse or boat.[3][7]

                In combat, the player can use long-range weapons such as rifles and bows,[3][8] and short-range weapons
                such as pistols and revolvers.[5] The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons such as
                machetes and hammers,[9] and throw bricks and bottles to distract or attack enemies.[10] Collected items
                can be used to upgrade weapons at workbenches[11] or craft equipment such as health kits, Molotov
                cocktails, and makeshift silencers.[1] The player can collect supplements to upgrade skills in a skill
                tree; training manuals found throughout the environment unlock additional skill tree branches, allowing
                upgrades to attributes such as the health meter, crafting speed, and ammunition types.[12]

                Though the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak
                past them.[1] "Listen Mode" allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing
                and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects.[10] In the cover system,
                the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain advantages in combat, and can also crawl in a prone
                position to evade enemies.[13] Hostile enemies use artificial intelligence; they may take cover or call
                for assistance, and can take advantage when the player is distracted, out of ammunition, or in a
                fight.[14] The player may be impaled by an arrow, which will progressively decrease their health meter
                and disables Listen Mode until removed when in cover.[15] Player companions, such as Dina, assist in
                combat by killing enemies or announcing their location.[16] The game introduces guard dogs that track
                the player's scent, which can be visualized in Listen Mode.
