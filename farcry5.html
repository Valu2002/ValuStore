            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>In late 2018, a joint operation between the United States Marshals Service and the county sheriff's
                department—consisting of Deputy Marshal Cameron Burke (Doug Hutchison), Sheriff Earl Whitehorse
                (Christopher Heyerdahl) and his deputies Joey Hudson (Luisa D'Oliveira), Staci Pratt (Julian Bailey) and
                the player character, an unnamed Junior Deputy—arrive at an Eden's Gate church to detain Joseph Seed
                with a federal arrest warrant on charges of kidnapping with the intent to harm. Although Joseph offers
                no resistance, he claims that God will not allow him to be taken. As he is escorted away, cult members
                attack the task force and cause their helicopter to crash. Joseph escapes and commands the cult to
                capture the task force members.[14]

                The Deputy survives and escapes with the help of Richard "Dutch" Roosevelt, a local survivalist and
                Vietnam War veteran who explains that the cult has interpreted the attempt to arrest Joseph as the
                fulfillment of his prophecies. Believing the end of the world is upon them, they have begun "the
                Reaping", a concentrated effort to purge Hope County of non-believers and gather all material needs. As
                the county is now cut off from the outside world, Dutch tasks the Deputy with contacting the fledgling
                resistance scattered throughout Hope County to gather allies, rescue the task force and dismantle the
                cult's operations to erode the influence of Joseph and the Heralds. Although the Heralds focus their
                efforts on stopping the Deputy, they maintain an interest in recruiting them to their cause.

                Joseph's younger brother John lures the Deputy to Holland Valley by broadcasting a message showing
                Hudson as his captive. John indoctrinates residents to the cult's beliefs by subjecting them to a forced
                baptism to "cleanse" them, tattooing their "sins" onto their bodies, and carving out the marked skin as
                part of their "atonement". John captures the Deputy and concludes that their sin is Wrath. When the
                Deputy escapes, John retaliates by taking over the town of Fall's End where he forces the Deputy to
                confront him and atone for their sins. A counterattack by the local Resistance prompts John to flee,
                leading to the Deputy engaging him in an aerial dogfight and mortally wounding him. As he lies dying,
                John remarks that the Deputy will not save anyone and asserts that Joseph is right. The Deputy rescues
                Hudson and the captive survivors and destroys John's bunker.

                The Deputy arrives in the Whitetail Mountains to find the Whitetail Militia already at war with Joseph's
                older brother Jacob. Jacob recruits and trains the cult's members and keeps an indoctrinated Deputy
                Pratt captive. As part of their training, Jacob mentally conditions cult recruits with The Platters'
                song "Only You (And You Alone)", which he uses to trigger an altered state of consciousness in the
                recruits and carry out his commands. Jacob subjects the Deputy to the same conditioning and successfully
                breaks them. He has the Deputy kill militia leader Eli Palmer (Patrick Garrow) to cripple the
                resistance. The surviving militia hold Jacob responsible and the Deputy confronts him in the mountains.
                As he dies, Jacob reflects on how empires rise and fall, and predicts that America will suffer the same
                fate if it is not prepared. The Deputy retrieves Jacob's bunker key, rescues Pratt and floods the
                bunker.

                Faith, a collaborator and "sister" of the Seeds, oversees the production of Bliss in Henbane River. The
                hallucinatory effects of Bliss puts its victims in a trance-like state and staying under its influence
                for too long makes them vulnerable to Faith's hypnotic manipulation. The Deputy reunites with Whitehorse
                and joins the Cougars, based in the Hope County Jail. Whitehorse informs the Deputy that Burke has been
                captured and is now under the influence of the Bliss. The Deputy repeatedly encounters Faith, who
                attempts to persuade the Deputy to join her and live in paradise. The Deputy resists her and rescues
                Burke, unaware that he has been hypnotized. Burke kills Virgil Minkler, leader of the Cougars and Mayor
                of Fall's End, opens the jail to Eden's Gate, and kills himself. The Cougars suffer heavy losses
                repelling the cult and Whitehorse is captured. The Deputy kills Faith, and she warns them that Joseph is
                right about the end of the world, but the Deputy will decide what happens in the end. The Deputy rescues
                Whitehorse from Faith's bunker and destroys the production of Bliss.

                Killing his Heralds prompts Joseph to call the Deputy for a final confrontation at his church. He has
                captured the Deputy's allies from the resistance groups, hypnotized them with Bliss and is holding
                Whitehorse, Hudson, and Pratt hostage. Joseph offers the Deputy the option of walking away with their
                friends unharmed on the condition that they leave him and Eden's Gate alone.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Similar to its predecessors, Far Cry 5 is a first-person shooter set in an open world environment which
                the player can explore freely on foot or via various vehicles. Unlike previous titles in the series
                where the player takes on the role of a set character, the game gives the player the opportunity to
                customize their character's appearance.[1][2] Additionally, the character in this game is a silent
                protagonist, devoid of voiced dialogue or a predefined personality, offering players the chance to
                deeply immerse themselves in the game, yet sparking concerns about the potential impact on the depth of
                narrative engagement.[3][4] While the player has a variety of ranged and explosive weapons to fight
                against enemies, the game places a renewed emphasis on close-quarters combat compared to previous Far
                Cry titles by introducing a wider range of melee weapons.[5] In addition, Far Cry 5 features a new
                weapons ballistics system that includes elements like a bullet dropping over a distance to increase
                realism.[6]

                Creative director Dan Hay described the design of the open world as being modeled on the outposts from
                previous titles in the Far Cry series. These outposts represented a small section of the map occupied by
                enemy forces and the player was tasked with liberating them by killing or neutralizing the enemy
                presence. The outposts were designed with multiple approaches for the player to take and it was this
                element that the development team tried to recreate in the wider game world of Far Cry 5. The player is
                dropped into the game world with little context, direction or objective markers and is instead required
                to navigate the world on their own. Hay expressed a desire to create what he termed the "anecdote
                factory", a game where two players could venture out from the same point in opposite directions and have
                entirely different experiences that they would then share with one another anecdotally.[7] To assist
                with this, most of the game world is accessible to the player after completing the game's introductory
                missions and they are free to advance through these areas as they choose; by comparison, previous titles
                in the series gradually opened up the game world to the player with story missions guiding their
                progress through open areas. Completing actions within a region earns the player "Resistance Points"
                which cumulate to trigger major story events. These Resistance Points also contribute to the "Resistance
                Meter", which divides each region into three tiers representing the region's relative level of
                difficulty. For example, on entering a region for the first time, the player will encounter basic
                enemies; however, as the Resistance Meter increases, the player will run into a wider variety of enemy
                archetypes, culminating in aerial patrols and airborne assaults.

                The game also features a recruitment system in which the player can recruit locals in the county to
                fight alongside them similar to the "Buddy" system used in Far Cry 2 or the "Guns for Hire" system in
                Far Cry 4. In this Guns for Hire system, the player can recruit locals to join their cause at which
                point they will fight alongside the player. In addition to these Guns for Hire, the game includes
                "Specialists" or non-playable characters with their own unique skills and personalities. The recruitment
                system replaces the beacon system used in previous titles. For example, Far Cry 3 featured radio towers
                and Far Cry 4 featured bell towers that the player had to climb in order to open up parts of the map and
                various activities in the region. Far Cry 5 removed this system and instead relies on the player forging
                relationships with other characters to discover story missions, events and other characters.[8]

                The player has the ability to tame wild animals through the Specialists, which is based on a system that
                was previously introduced to the series in Far Cry Primal. The tamed wildlife assists the player in
                combat and follow the player's orders. Different wildlife have different combat patterns.[9] A fishing
                mechanic was also introduced and a variety of fish can be caught.[10] The campaign can be played
                individually or with a partner through the game's cooperative multiplayer mode known as "Friends for
                Hire".
