            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>In the six months following the defeat of HADES (Anthony Ingruber),[b] Aloy has been searching
                fruitlessly for a working backup of GAIA (Lesley Ewen) to restore the planet's rapidly degrading
                biosphere. After she discovers that her former associate Sylens (Lance Reddick) did not destroy but
                stole HADES, he contacts Aloy and asks her to continue her search in the region known as the Forbidden
                West.

                Aloy and her friend Varl (John Macmillan) cross into the west to find the ruling Tenakth tribe amidst a
                civil war between Chief Hekarro (Geno Segers) and the rebel leader Regalla (Angela Bassett). Aloy tracks
                Sylens to a facility where she finds HADES badly damaged and permanently deletes it. She recovers a GAIA
                backup without its subsystems but is interrupted by a group of futuristic humans. The group, consisting
                of their leader Gerard Bieri (Dan Donohue), his lieutenant Tilda van der Meer (Carrie-Anne Moss),
                enforcer Erik Visser (Marc Kudisch), and a clone of Sobeck named Beta (also voiced by Burch), possess
                advanced technology that renders them invulnerable. They take a second GAIA backup, while Aloy barely
                escapes, and passes out when Varl manages to find her.

                Aloy awakens days later in the village of Plainsong, home to the Utaru tribe. Zo (Erica Luttrell), a
                member of the Utaru, guides Aloy to a control center, where she rejoins GAIA with her subsystem,
                MINERVA. GAIA locates the other subsystems, AETHER, DEMETER, and POSEIDON, and advises Aloy to retrieve
                them before attempting to capture the more advanced HEPHAESTUS. GAIA reveals that the extinction signal
                that triggered HADES and mutated the subsystems originated from the Sirius system; Aloy suspects that
                the futuristic humans sent it. She later tracks down Beta, who informs Aloy that her group is, in fact,
                Far Zenith, an organization of billionaire colonists who fled Earth during its global extinction, having
                managed to extend their natural lifespans. After their colony on Sirius collapsed, the Zeniths returned
                to Earth to use GAIA through Beta's genetic make-up for their own recolonization. They already acquired
                subsystems ELEUTHIA, ARTEMIS, and APOLLO, but Beta has stolen their GAIA backup.

                Aloy recovers AETHER after helping Hekarro advance in the civil war and retrieves POSEIDON from the
                ruins of Las Vegas. She also recruits one of Hekarro's Marshals, Kotallo (Noshir Dalal), to join her
                cause and work alongside Varl, Zo, and Oseram tribesman Erend (John Hopkins). Journeying to the San
                Francisco region, she encounters the Quen, a foreign tribe attempting to solve ecological crises in
                their homeland. Aloy helps tribe member Alva (Alison Jaye) acquire data while recovering DEMETER. After
                obtaining a high-level clearance from the private bunker-turned-tomb of a grotesquely mutated Ted Faro
                (Lloyd Owen) before it's burned down, Aloy recruits Alva for her mission, then later devises a plan to
                help GAIA trap HEPHAESTUS. Aloy travels with Varl and Beta to an inactive Cauldron to carry out their
                plan, but they are attacked by the Zeniths. Erik kills Varl and recaptures Beta, while Gerard steals
                GAIA, but Tilda double-crosses them and helps Aloy escape. Tilda explains that she was romantically
                involved with Elisabet Sobeck and regretted leaving her; having been inspired by Aloy, she wishes to
                stop Far Zenith. She further reveals that Sylens has been supporting the Tenakth rebels to use them
                against the Zeniths. Aloy refuses to sacrifice the Tenakth and instead defeats Regalla herself after
                thwarting the latter's final attack on Hekarro. She then convinces Tilda and Sylens to reconvene at her
                base to formulate a plan.

                Aloy and her companions assault Far Zenith's base, while Beta releases HEPHAESTUS into the Zeniths'
                network, and it builds a near-endless amount of machines that tie down Far Zenith's army of drones.
                Sylens disables the Zeniths' personal defenses, causing many of them to be killed by the rampaging
                machines. Aloy and Zo confront Erik and kill him to avenge Varl, while Tilda kills Gerard. Aloy and Beta
                learn that the Far Zenith colony was destroyed by Nemesis, a failed mind uploading experiment they
                created; the Zeniths fled from Nemesis and hoped to steal GAIA to colonize a new planet. Nemesis also
                sent the extinction signal to Earth and is en route to destroy the planet. Tilda tries to force Aloy to
                abandon Earth with her, but Aloy refuses and is forced to kill Tilda. Sylens reveals that HADES told him
                about Nemesis and also plans to escape Earth, but has a change of heart and decides to aid Aloy against
                Nemesis. Aloy's companions disperse to spread the warning of Nemesis while Aloy and Beta reactivate
                GAIA. </p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>One of the team's biggest goals was to "recapture the magic" of the original game. As with the original
                game, the team identified three main pillars for development: having strong and memorable characters,
                exploration emphasizing the majesty of nature and ancient ruins, and "clever" combat which encourages
                strategic planning.[33] As Aloy journeys into the Forbidden West, the team wanted to ensure that "there
                is always a mystery for her to unravel, and always more for her to explore."[34] As a result, underwater
                and aerial exploration were added to the game, though the development of both were noted to be
                challenging from a technical perspective.[35] Quest designer Samantha Schoonen described underwater
                exploration as a "natural extension to traverse long-lost unknown places". The team intentionally
                avoided the oppressive tone typically found in underwater levels in other video games and instead
                focused on "fast and agile traversal" and stealth gameplay.[36] The gameplay was designed to promote the
                player's choices. For instance, new tools were introduced to aid transversal and exploration as well as
                provide multiple ways to solve environmental puzzles; various playstyles were supported, enabling
                players to choose how they engage with enemies and switch between playstyles at will;[37] and skill
                trees were also overhauled completely.[10] Cauldrons return from Zero Dawn, though their designs are
                more varied to upset the player's expectations. Some cauldrons were also tied to larger and more
                extensive set pieces.[38]

                The gameplay team identified Aloy as a "smart, fast, agile, precise, and resourceful" character and had
                to translate these personal qualities into gameplay mechanics. Melee and ranged combat were more
                interweaved together, with Valor Surges such as the Resonator Blast allowing players to quickly change
                from melee to ranged combat.[37] The team introduced more variety to human enemies, such as armored
                enemies; their artificial intelligence was also designed to be more aggressive.[34] Whereas in Zero
                Dawn, human and machine enemies were two disparate groups, Forbidden West integrates the two together by
                having Aloy fight against human enemies commandeering machines.[37] A number of new machines were
                introduced in Forbidden West, including the Sunwing (inspired by flying reptiles and primitive birds)
                and the Tremortusk (inspired by mammoths and war elephants). Zero Dawn establishes the machines in the
                game as caretakers of the world, and the team programmed each machine type to exhibit behaviors that
                will match their roles in an ecosystem.[39] Additional textures were added to each machine so the player
                could better identify their weak points visually, and more audio cues were introduced to better signal
                their actions to the player.[40] Machine hunting is more vital in Forbidden West, as it became a more
                integral part of crafting.[41]

                The world in Forbidden West is slightly larger than that in Zero Dawn, though the studio focused on
                increasing the world's density to ensure that it was filled with content.[34] NPCs encountered in side
                quests may reappear as the player progresses further, and the team rewarded players more handsomely with
                side quests and tied them to the overarching narrative, so completing them felt more worthwhile.[4]
                After evaluating player feedback on Zero Dawn, the team decided to make each settlement more dynamic by
                introducing a "general sense of them being more lifelike" with improved animations and better NPC AI
                patterns and schedules.[4] An improved crowd system was introduced, with a more diverse range of audio,
                so that each area within a settlement will sound different.[41] As Aloy heads west, she will encounter
                members of different tribes. According to the team, the Oseram are "social and historically
                patriarchal", the Utaru are "agrarian" and more laid-back in nature, while the Tenakth are more militant
                and combat-focused. The team created various animations and outfits distinct to each tribe, highlighting
                the differences in their ways of life.[4] It also allowed the player to identify tribe members from afar
                visually and enabled them to get a bearing of where they are in the world.[42] </p>
