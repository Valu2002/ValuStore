            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Many years after defeating the Olympian gods,[e] Kratos lives with his son Atreus in Midgard and is often
                abrasive towards him. After cremating the body of Faye, Kratos is confronted by a stranger with godly
                powers. The two battle and Kratos seemingly kills the stranger, after which Kratos and Atreus begin
                their journey to honor Faye's last wish: to scatter her ashes at the highest peak in the nine realms.
                Along the way, they encounter the kindly Witch of the Woods, who recognizes Kratos's godhood.

                Kratos and Atreus find their path blocked by impenetrable black mist; the Witch instructs them to travel
                to Alfheim and secure its magical light to extinguish the mist. Successful, they reach Midgard's peak
                and overhear a conversation between the stranger—revealed to be Baldur—and his nephews, Modi and Magni,
                as well as the imprisoned Mímir. After they leave, Kratos and Atreus confront Mímir, who reveals the
                highest peak is actually in Jötunheim, but the Giants have blocked travel there. Knowing of another
                passage, Mímir instructs Kratos to behead him and have his head revived by the Witch of the Woods, whom,
                upon resurrection, he reveals to be the goddess Freya. Kratos's longstanding hatred of gods causes him
                to distrust her, but both Freya and Mímir warn him he must tell Atreus about his true nature.

                Kratos, Atreus, and Mímir are attacked by Modi and Magni. After Kratos kills Magni, Modi flees but later
                ambushes the trio. Kratos fends him off, but Atreus collapses, overcome by illness due to the
                contradiction of a god believing himself to be mortal. Freya instructs Kratos to retrieve the heart of a
                specific troll in Helheim; however, his frost-based Leviathan Axe is useless in the icy realm. Kratos
                returns home to unearth his old weapons, the fiery Blades of Chaos, and is haunted by Athena's spirit.
                After retrieving the heart, he has a haunting vision of Zeus. Freya revives Atreus, and Kratos tells him
                they are gods. Atreus becomes increasingly arrogant and, against Kratos's orders, murders a weakened
                Modi, who was beaten by Thor for not avenging Magni. At Midgard's peak, Kratos and Atreus are ambushed
                by Baldur, resulting in Jötunheim's portal being destroyed. Their battle descends to Týr's Temple, and
                the group ends up in Helheim.

                Atreus makes amends with Kratos. They learn of Freya and Baldur's familial relationship and the spell of
                invulnerability she cast on him. Returning to Midgard, Mímir realizes another way to reach Jötunheim,
                but needs his missing eye. After obtaining it, the group are attacked by Baldur once more, but Freya
                intervenes to protect her son. Baldur is pierced by Atreus's mistletoe arrow, breaking Freya's spell.
                Baldur is defeated and attempts to strangle Freya, causing Kratos to kill him. A grief-stricken Freya
                vows to avenge Baldur's death, blaming it on Kratos, and leaves with Baldur's corpse. Kratos tells
                Atreus about his own past and how he killed his own father. Atreus laments this cycle of violence, and
                Kratos tells him they should not repeat the mistakes of their predecessors, including those made by
                Kratos himself.

                Kratos and Atreus reach Jötunheim. They find an abandoned temple with a mural depicting their
                adventures, showing that the Giants, renowned for their gift of prophecy, had foretold their journey.
                They discover Faye was a Giant who had decided to stay in Midgard, meaning Atreus is half Giant,
                one-quarter god, and one-quarter mortal. Their fight with Baldur is shown, revealing he sought Faye the
                whole time under orders from Odin, unaware she was dead and Atreus was referred to as Loki by his mother
                and the Giants. Kratos chooses to ignore a covered mural depicting what appears to be him dying in
                Atreus's arms. They fulfill their promise and spread Faye's ashes at the peak. Afterward, Kratos reveals
                to Atreus that his given name was that of a compassionate Spartan comrade. Returning to Midgard, they
                retrieve Mímir, who warns them Baldur's death has caused the three-year-long Fimbulwinter to begin
                nearly a century earlier than prophesized, meaning Ragnarök is soon to follow.

                In a secret ending, Kratos and Atreus, along with Mímir, return home and slumber. Atreus has a vision of
                Thor arriving at the end of Fimbulwinter to confront them.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>God of War is a third-person action-adventure video game. It features an over-the-shoulder free camera (a
                departure from the previous installments which featured a fixed cinematic camera, with the exception of
                2007's two-dimensional side-scroller Betrayal).[7] Cinematographically, the game is presented in a
                continuous shot, with no camera cuts or loading screens.[8] Although the previous main installment,
                Ascension (2013), introduced multiplayer to the series, this installment is single-player-only.[4]
                Regarding the level structure, creative director Cory Barlog said "it's open, but it is not an open
                world."[9] Due to its openness, a fast travel feature is unlocked later in the game.[10] Swimming, an
                ability in previous games, was cut;[11] players instead use a boat to traverse bodies of water.[10]
                Unlike previous games, which allowed players to jump freely at any time, jumping can now only be done at
                designated areas, such as at a rock face or ledge. Throughout the game, players battle Norse
                mythological foes, like dark elves, wulvers, and draugrs,[12] as well as Gullveig and the revenants,
                beings warped by seiðr magic, among many others.[13] Valkyries appear as optional secret boss battles
                throughout the six playable locations.[14] Among the many side quests, players can free the imprisoned
                dragons Fáfnir, Otr, and Reginn—dwarves who were turned into dragons—in addition to battling one called
                Hræzlyr, a story-based boss battle.
                The player controls the character Kratos in combo-based combat and puzzle game elements. The gameplay is
                vastly different from previous games, as it was completely rebuilt.[9] A major change is that Kratos no
                longer uses his signature double-chained blades, the Blades of Chaos, as his default weapon. Instead, he
                uses a magical battle axe called the Leviathan Axe,[16] which is infused with ice elemental magic. The
                axe can be thrown at enemies and magically summoned back to his hand, similar to Thor's hammer Mjölnir.
                Larger enemies have precision targets which stun the enemy if hit. The weapon can also be thrown at
                objects in the game world to freeze or move mechanisms, or trigger damaging explosions, until returned
                to Kratos's hand. The axe has standard light and heavy attacks. Over time, it can be upgraded with runes
                to allow for light and heavy magical "runic" attacks. This provides players with a variety of options to
                cater to their own play style.[17] Another new weapon that Kratos utilizes is the collapsible Guardian
                Shield, which appears as a vambrace on his left forearm when not in use. The shield can be used
                offensively or defensively, similar to the Golden Fleece in previous games.[18] Kratos also utilizes
                hand-to-hand combat, a feature originally introduced in Ascension.[7] The Blades of Chaos, infused with
                fire elemental magic, are acquired later in the game via a plot device and perform in a similar manner
                as in previous installments—they are a pair of blades attached to chains that can be swung around in
                various maneuvers. The weapon can also be upgraded with magical runic attacks.[19]

                As in the earlier games, there is a "Rage" ability, this one called Spartan Rage. Like in previous
                games, the Rage ability has a meter that gradually fills during combat. With this ability, Kratos uses
                powerful bare-handed attacks, as opposed to weapons, to greatly damage enemies. The game also features
                role-playing game (RPG) elements.[7][20] There are crafting resources for the player to find that allow
                them to create new or upgrade existing armor with better perks.[21] Players also accumulate a currency
                called Hacksilver, a key component in crafting and purchasing new items. Experience points (XP) are used
                for learning new combat skills.[20] Throughout the game world, players find chests containing random
                items, such as enchantments for improving armor and weapons, as well as the Hacksilver currency. There
                are also two special items, Iðunn's Apples and horns of Blood Mead, which increase Kratos's maximum
                health and Rage, respectively. These meters are replenished by green and red orbs dropped by downed foes
                and found throughout the game world. For the magical runic attacks, instead of collecting blue orbs to
                replenish the ability (like in the previous games), there is a cooldown timer for each ability.[22]

                Quick time events have changed from previous games.[9] Enemies display two meters above their heads, one
                for health (the color of which indicates the enemy's difficulty) and the other for stun. Filling the
                stun meter helps to defeat more difficult enemies. When the stun meter is full, a grab prompt will
                appear. Depending on the enemy, Kratos may rip them in half or grab them and throw them into other
                enemies, among other possible outcomes.[23] Although the game is played entirely as Kratos,[24] there
                are times when the player may choose to passively control his son, Atreus. One button is dedicated to
                Atreus, and its use depends on the context. For example, if the player needs assistance, they can look
                at an enemy and press the button, and Atreus will shoot an arrow at the enemy.[25] Over the course of
                the game, Atreus helps in combat, traversal, exploration, and puzzle-solving. When facing a large number
                of enemies, he distracts the weaker ones as Kratos fights the stronger ones.[21] If too many enemies
                gang up on Atreus, he is briefly stunned, but he cannot be knocked out or killed. Atreus also acquires
                new skills, armor, and runic attacks, as well as special light and shock arrows for his bow. Atreus's
                runic attacks summon different spectral animals with different abilities. For example, one summons a
                pack of wolves that attacks enemies, while another summons the squirrel Ratatoskr, who will dig up
                health and rage orbs.
