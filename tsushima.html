            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>In 1274, a Mongol fleet led by Khotun Khan invades the Japanese island of Tsushima. The jitō, Lord
                Shimura, and his nephew Jin Sakai lead an effort by the five great families of the island to repel the
                invaders as they land. However, the battle ends in disaster, with the samurai killed by the superior
                weapons of the Mongols, Shimura captured, and Jin severely wounded and left for dead. He is found and
                revived by the scavenger Yuna, who informs him that the whole of the island has fallen to the invaders.
                Jin storms Khotun's stronghold at Castle Kaneda in an attempt to rescue Shimura but is defeated by
                Khotun and thrown off the castle bridge.

                Realizing he cannot defeat the Mongols alone or with traditional samurai tactics, Jin recruits allies
                and learns tactics of guerilla warfare from Yuna. He recruits Yuna, her blacksmith brother Taka, sake
                merchant and swindler Kenji, archer Sadanobu Ishikawa, samurai Masako Adachi, and his mercenary friend
                Ryuzo along with Ryuzo's Straw Hat rōnin. As Jin disrupts Mongol activities and liberates villages, the
                islanders begin to refer to him as "The Ghost," a samurai spirit that has risen against the Mongols.
                Taka crafts a grappling hook for Jin to scale Castle Kaneda's walls, and Jin attacks the site with his
                allies. Destitute and starving from harsh wartime conditions, Ryuzo and the Straw Hats betray Jin to
                collect the bounty issued to him by Khotun. Jin fends them off, frees Shimura, and retakes Castle
                Kaneda. Despite their victory, Khotun has already left to conquer Castle Shimura with Ryuzo.

                Jin recruits Norio, Norio's warrior monks, and the disgraced Yarikawa family to retake Castle Shimura.
                He also recruits local pirate Goro on Shimura's behalf to carry a petition for reinforcements and a
                request to be adopted as his heir to the shogun. With a new army being assembled, Jin recovers his
                family's ancestral armor from the Sakai family caretaker Yuriko, who teaches him how to create poison.
                Under orders from Shimura, Jin and Taka try to infiltrate a fortress where Ryuzo is located but are
                ambushed and captured by Khotun. When Jin refuses to submit to his rule, Khotun demands Taka kill him in
                exchange for his freedom. Taka instead attempts to attack Khotun, but he avoids and decapitates him. Jin
                then escapes with Yuna's help. The Shogun's reinforcements arrive, and Shimura leads the assembled army
                in an assault on Castle Shimura, driving the Mongols into the inner keep. As the Mongols retreat, they
                detonate explosives on the bridge leading to the inner courtyard, inflicting massive casualties on the
                advancing samurai.

                Knowing that another frontal attack would only result in more losses, Jin decides to infiltrate the keep
                and sneak poison into the Mongols' airag. He also exacts revenge for Taka's death by cutting down Ryuzo.
                However, he again misses Khotun, who has retreated to a stronghold in the north. Despite the castle
                being taken without the samurai suffering any further losses, Shimura is furious with Jin, as his
                actions have violated the samurai code of honor. Jin retorts by criticizing the ineffectiveness of the
                code against the dishonorable Mongols. Knowing that the Shogun will have Jin executed for treason,
                Shimura urges him to use Yuna as a scapegoat, but Jin refuses and embraces his persona as "The Ghost."
                Shimura regretfully has Jin arrested. Jin's allies remain loyal to him and help him escape captivity,
                but his horse is fatally shot by archers in the process. Jin travels north and learns that the Mongols
                have learned how to craft his poison, which they intend to use in their assault on the Japanese
                mainland. Before gathering his allies and assaulting Khotun's final stronghold in Port Izumi, Jin leaves
                a note for Shimura in his castle asking him to join the effort with the samurai, which he does. With the
                bulk of the Mongol forces distracted, Jin infiltrates the port and kills Khotun on his flagship.

                With Khotun dead, the Mongol invasion loses momentum, and the tide turns in favor of the samurai.
                Shimura informs Jin that the Shogun considers him a threat to the island's stability and status quo of
                obedience of the people to their leaders. He states that the Shogun has disbanded Clan Sakai and ordered
                Shimura to kill Jin. Reminiscing about what they have both lost, Jin and Shimura reluctantly duel each
                other, with Jin emerging victorious. Jin can either kill Shimura to give him a proper warrior's death or
                abandon the samurai code and spare his life completely. Regardless of the decision, Jin becomes the
                enemy of the Shogun but continues protecting the land from remaining Mongols and bandits.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Ghost of Tsushima is an action-adventure video game played from a third-person perspective. The player
                has a variety of gameplay options to reach objectives they are given. They can engage in a "standoff", a
                direct confrontation with enemies using their katana, which can result in a series of fatal strikes
                against a number of different enemies.[1] In combat, Jin can use different fighting stances to defeat
                specific types of enemies: "stone stance" for hostile swordsmen; "water stance" for shielded enemies;
                "wind stance" for spearmen; and "moon stance" for brutes.[2] Eventually the player unlocks "ghost
                stance", which makes Jin invincible and allows him to kill enemies with a single hit for a limited
                period of time. To activate ghost stance, players must kill a number of enemies without taking any
                damage or assassinate a Mongol leader.[3] The player needs to stagger enemies or land a successful parry
                to break their defense before attacking to deplete their health.[4] The player has access to bows, which
                can fire multiple types of arrows. At certain points in the game, Jin must duel against non-playable
                characters (NPCs) who act as bosses with unique offensive tactics and attack animations.[5] The game's
                highest difficulty is a more realistic mode in which the player and enemies do large amounts of damage
                to each other, with all non-boss fights ending in one or two successful attacks.[6]

                Alternatively, using stealth allows the player to evade enemies and strike them silently. As the player
                progresses in the game they can unlock chained assassination, which allows Jin to strike several enemies
                consecutively. To this end, Jin has a large arsenal of ghost weapons. These include firecrackers and
                wind chime bells to create distractions, smoke bombs to disorient alerted foes, kunai for striking
                multiple enemies, and explosives to kill groups of enemies.[7] Players will eventually unlock a blowgun
                that allows them to shoot poison darts and causes victims to hallucinate and attack their peers.[8] When
                the player restores Jin's health or uses special combat techniques, they deplete their "resolve", which
                is gained by performing feats of finesse such as assassinating or parrying an enemy.[9]

                The game features a large open world which can be explored with or without guidance based on wind
                direction.[10] The three islands of Tsushima are unlocked gradually as the player progresses. The island
                of Izuhara is unlocked first, followed by Totoyama and Kamiagata.[11] Players travel to different parts
                of Tsushima on horseback and can use an item that acts as a grappling hook to access difficult-to-reach
                areas.[12] As the player explores the world, yellow birds will guide Jin to locations of interest. These
                include hot springs which increase Jin's maximum health, "Bamboo Strikes" which increase Jin's maximum
                resolve upon completion, "Pillars of Honor" which contain additional cosmetic designs for Jin's weapons,
                and locations in which Jin will meditate and compose haiku.[b] By following torii gates and completing a
                platforming challenge, the player will find Shinto shrines and unlock charms that grant the player
                passive perks such as decreasing damage taken, reducing enemy detection speed, and increasing how much
                health is recovered when healing.[14][15] Foxes will also lead Jin to Inari shrines, which increase the
                number of charms Jin can equip.[16]

                The game features side quests and NPCs with whom the player can interact.[17] Players can also liberate
                Mongol-controlled villages and camps by eliminating all the enemies stationed in the area. Combat
                stances are unlocked after Jin observes or kills Mongol leaders.[18] Completing side quests or helping
                NPCs grants players minor charms[19] and gifts which can be collected at altars.[20] In particular,
                completing "Mythic Tale" side quests will unlock unique armors and special combat techniques.[21] Each
                armor set has different properties that provide various benefits during combat. Most sets of armor and
                clothing can be upgraded by collecting materials found in the game's world. Jin's appearance can also be
                further customized with masks, helmets and headbands.
