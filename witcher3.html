            <p>Geralt and his mentor Vesemir arrive at the town of White Orchard after receiving a letter from Geralt's
                long-lost lover Yennefer. After defeating a griffin for the local Nilfgaardian garrison, Geralt
                accompanies Yennefer to the city of Vizima, where they meet with Emperor Emhyr. Emhyr orders Geralt to
                find Ciri, who is Emhyr's biological (and Geralt's adopted) daughter. Ciri is a Child of the Elder
                Blood, the last heir to an ancient Elven bloodline that grants her the power to manipulate time and
                space, and is being relentlessly stalked by the enigmatic Wild Hunt. Geralt learns of three places Ciri
                was recently seen: the war-ravaged swamp province of Velen, the free city-state of Novigrad, and the
                Skellige Isles.

                In Velen, Geralt tracks Ciri to the fortress of The Bloody Baron, a warlord who recently took over the
                province. The Baron demands that Geralt find his missing wife and daughter in exchange for information
                about Ciri. Geralt learns that the Baron drove his own family away with his drunken rages; while his
                daughter fled to Oxenfurt, his wife Anna became a servant of the Crones, three malicious witches that
                watch over Velen. He also discovers that Ciri was briefly captured by the Crones, but escaped to the
                Baron's stronghold before continuing on to Novigrad.

                At Novigrad, Geralt reunites with his former lover Triss Merigold, who has gone underground to escape
                persecution by the Church of the Eternal Fire. He learns that Ciri and his old friend Dandelion ran
                afoul of Novigrad's powerful crime bosses while seeking to break a curse related to a mysterious
                phylactery. With the help of Triss and several old acquaintances, Geralt rescues Dandelion, who tells
                him that Ciri teleported away to escape pursuit by guards.

                Geralt sails to Skellige and reunites with Yennefer, who is investigating a magical explosion near where
                Ciri was last seen. They discover that Ciri visited the island of Lofoten, but when the Wild Hunt
                attacked again, fled in a boat with an unidentified elf. When the boat returned to shore, its only
                occupant was Uma, a deformed creature Geralt previously saw living with the Bloody Baron. Deducing that
                Uma was the victim of the curse Ciri tried to lift in Novigrad, Geralt collects Uma in Velen and takes
                him to the nearly abandoned witcher school at Kaer Morhen. Working with Yennefer and his fellow
                witchers, Geralt breaks the curse and restores Uma's true identity: Avallac'h, Ciri's teacher and the
                elf seen with her on her travels. Avallac'h tells Geralt that he placed Ciri in an enchanted sleep on
                the Isle of Mists to keep her temporarily safe from the Wild Hunt.

                Geralt finds Ciri on the Isle of Mists and learns from her that Eredin, the leader of the Wild Hunt,
                wants her Elder Blood powers to save his homeworld from a catastrophe known as the White Frost. They
                return to Kaer Morhen and fortify it against the inevitable arrival of the Hunt. In the battle that
                ensues, Vesemir is killed, causing Ciri to unleash her uncontrolled power and temporarily send the Hunt
                into retreat.

                Realizing that the Hunt will never stop, Ciri and Geralt decide to fight Eredin at a time and place of
                their choosing. While Triss and Yennefer reform the Lodge of Sorceresses to aid in the fight, Geralt
                recovers the Sunstone, an artifact that can communicate between worlds. Using the Sunstone, Avallac'h
                lures Eredin to Skellige, where Geralt defeats him in combat. As he dies, Eredin tells Geralt that
                Avallac'h has betrayed him, and plans to use Ciri's power for his own ends.

                As the White Frost begins to encroach on the Continent, Geralt and Yennefer pursue Avallac'h, but find
                Ciri alive and well. She tells Geralt that Avallac'h is not a traitor, and has only ever intended to
                fight the White Frost. Thinking back on her relationship with Geralt, Ciri finds the strength to stop
                the cataclysm; if Geralt patronized and protected her throughout the game, she dies in the attempt, but
                if he guided her to mature and make her own choices, she survives.

                The player's choices can lead to several different endings. If Ciri survives after defeating the White
                Frost and Geralt took her to meet her father, she will become the Empress of Nilfgaard. If Ciri survives
                but did not meet the emperor, Geralt helps her fake her death, and she becomes a witcher. If Ciri is
                killed in her confrontation with the White Frost, Geralt retrieves her medallion from the last remaining
                Crone and mourns quietly as his hut is swarmed by monsters. The player's choices also determine whether
                Geralt ends up in a romantic relationship with Yennefer, Triss, or neither, and how much of the North is
                ultimately conquered by Nilfgaard.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action role-playing game with a third-person perspective. Players control
                Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer known as a Witcher.[1] Geralt walks, runs, rolls and dodges, and (for
                the first time in the series) jumps, climbs and swims.[2][3] He has a variety of weapons, including
                bombs, a crossbow and two swords (one steel and one silver).[4] The steel sword is used primarily to
                kill humans while the silver sword is more effective against creatures and monsters.[5] Players can draw
                out, switch and sheathe their swords at will. There are two modes of melee attack; light attacks are
                fast but weak, and heavy attacks are slow but strong.[6] Players can block and counter enemy attacks
                with their swords.[4] Swords have limited endurance and require regular repair.[7] In addition to
                physical attacks, Geralt has five magical signs at his disposal: Aard, Axii, Igni, Yrden and Quen.[8]
                Aard prompts Geralt to unleash a telekinetic blast, Axii confuses enemies, Igni burns them, Yrden slows
                them down and Quen offers players a temporary, protective shield.[9] The signs use stamina, and cannot
                be used indefinitely.[10] Players can use mutagens to increase Geralt's magic power. Geralt loses health
                when attacked by enemies, although wearing armour can help reduce health loss. Health is restored with
                meditation or consumables, such as food and potions.[4] Players occasionally control Ciri, Geralt's
                adoptive daughter who can teleport short distances.[11]

                The game has responsive, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and dynamic environments. The day-night
                cycle influences some monsters; a werewolf becomes powerful during the night of a full moon.[12] Players
                can learn about their enemies and prepare for combat by reading the in-game bestiary.[13] When they kill
                an enemy, they can loot its corpse for valuables.[13] Geralt's witcher sense enables players to find
                objects of interest, including items that can be collected or scavenged.[14] Items are stored in the
                inventory, which can be expanded by purchasing upgrades.[13] Players can sell items to vendors[15] or
                use them to craft potions and bombs.[16][17] They can visit blacksmiths to craft new weapons and
                armorers to craft new armour with what they have gathered.[18] The price of an item and the cost of
                crafting it depend on a region's local economy.[3] Players earn experience points by completing
                quests.[3] When a player earns enough experience, Geralt's level increases and the player receives
                ability points.[19] These points may be used on four skill trees: combat, signs, alchemy and general.
                Combat upgrades enhance Geralt's attacks and unlock new fighting techniques; signs upgrades enable him
                to use magic more efficiently, and alchemy upgrades improve crafting abilities. General upgrades have a
                variety of functions, from raising Geralt's vitality to increasing crossbow damage.[10]

                The game focuses on narrative and has a dialogue tree which allows players to choose how to respond to
                non-player characters. Geralt must make decisions which change the state of the world and lead to 36
                possible endings, affecting the lives of in-game characters.[20] He can have a romantic relationship
                with some of the game's female characters by completing certain quests.[21] In addition to the main
                quests, books offer more information on the game's world.[13] Players can begin side quests after
                visiting a town's noticeboard.[13] These side missions include Witcher Contracts (elaborate missions
                requiring players to hunt monsters)[22] and Treasure Hunt quests, which reward players with top-tier
                weapons or armour.[13] The game's open world is divided into several regions. Geralt can explore each
                region on foot or by transportation, such as a boat. Roach, his horse, may be summoned at will.[23]
                Players can kill enemies with their sword while riding Roach,[24] but an enemy presence may frighten the
                horse and unseat Geralt.[13] Points of interest may be found on the map, and players receive experience
                points after completing mini-missions in these regions.[25] Players can discover Places of Power for
                additional ability points.[26] Other activities include horse racing, boxing and card playing;[27][28]
                the card-playing mechanic was later expanded into a standalone game, Gwent: The Witcher Card Game.
