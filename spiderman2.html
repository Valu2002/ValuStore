            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>Peter starts his first day as a physics teacher at Brooklyn Visions Academy with Miles among his
                students, but they are interrupted by a rampaging Sandman, requiring both Spider-Men to subdue him.
                Fired for abandoning the class, Peter returns to his Aunt May's home in Queens–which he has moved into
                following her death[a]–to meet with Mary Jane. They are surprised by Harry, who has miraculously
                recovered from his terminal illness. Harry hires Peter to work at his environmental technology startup,
                the Emily-May Foundation (Named after Aunt May and Harry's mother Emily), so they can pursue his dream
                of "healing the world". Concurrently, Kraven and his Hunters infiltrate New York.

                While overseeing a prisoner transfer, a vengeful Miles fails to stop the Hunters from capturing Martin
                Li, who previously killed his father Jefferson Davis.[a] While investigating Kraven, Peter discovers he
                is hunting super-powered individuals in search of an "equal" before he dies of cancer. Having already
                killed Scorpion, Vulture, Shocker, and Electro, Kraven attempts to capture Black Cat. However, Miles
                helps her escape to Paris. While visiting Coney Island to reconnect, Peter, Mary Jane, and Harry witness
                the Hunters attack the park to capture a reformed Tombstone. While Peter rescues civilians, he is
                assisted by a super-powered Harry, who learns about Peter's double life and reveals that he was cured by
                Curt Connors via a powerful organic exosuit that physically augments his body, on his father Norman
                Osborn’s insistence.

                With the exosuit's powers rapidly developing, Harry helps Peter rescue Tombstone while Mary Jane
                discovers that Kraven has kidnapped Connors. The trio attempt to save Connors, but Kraven forcibly turns
                him back into the Lizard. Kraven mortally wounds Peter, who is saved when the exosuit transfers itself
                to his body. After Peter confronts the Hunters with his newly enhanced powers, Kraven develops an
                interest in hunting Peter personally.

                After Peter and Harry synthesize an antidote for Connors, Peter locates him with Miles' help and
                eventually defeats and cures him. Upon seeing Peter wearing the exosuit, Connors explains that it is
                actually an alien called a symbiote, which Oscorp obtained years prior, and warns Peter to destroy it.
                Under the symbiote's corrupting influence, Peter refuses and keeps it for himself despite learning that
                Harry's illness has returned, straining their friendship. As Peter goes on a symbiote-induced rampage
                against the Hunters, Kraven captures Miles and forces him to fight Li. Miles overcomes his anger towards
                Li and helps him escape, directing him to find Peter. Once Li informs him of Miles' location, Peter
                arrives to storm Kraven’s fortress in an effort to rescue him and nearly kills Kraven before Miles
                intervenes and convinces him to remove the symbiote.

                Peter takes the symbiote to Oscorp to destroy it, but a desperate Harry intercepts him and reclaims it,
                transforming into a monstrous creature. After slaughtering Oscorp staff who are preparing to remove the
                symbiote from him, the symbiote-induced Harry escapes into Times Square, where he kills several of
                Kraven's Hunters before overpowering and killing Kraven himself. Introducing itself as Venom, the
                symbiote convinces Harry to "heal the world" by infecting everyone in it with symbiotes, starting with
                New York. Amidst this, Venom transforms Mary Jane into Scream, but Peter helps her break free after
                battling and reconciling with her. As Peter and Miles attempt to stop Venom, Peter is debilitated by a
                trace amount of the symbiote still in him. After Miles settles his differences with Li, the latter uses
                his powers to convert it into the Anti-Venom symbiote, which can destroy other symbiotes. Concurrently,
                Venom recovers the meteorite that originally brought him to Earth and empowers himself with it,
                accelerating the invasion. Peter and Miles distract Venom while Mary Jane steals the meteorite and
                destroys it with the EMF's particle accelerator, destroying Venom's spawn. At Harry's insistence, Peter
                destroys Venom, freeing Harry from its control, but rendering Harry comatose.

                In the aftermath, Mary Jane quits the Daily Bugle to run her own podcast and moves in with Peter, who
                opts to take a break from being Spider-Man to focus on rebuilding the EMF, trusting Miles to protect the
                city. Norman blames the Spider-Men for ruining Harry's recovery and visits an imprisoned Otto Octavius
                to demand their secret identities, but Octavius refuses, taking glee in Norman's suffering. Miles
                completes his college essay and meets Rio's new boyfriend, Albert Moon, who introduces them to his
                daughter Cindy.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is an action-adventure single-player[1] video game played from a third-person
                perspective. As with the first game and Miles Morales, Peter Parker and Miles Morales are the two main
                characters, with Mary Jane and Venom[2] playable in certain missions, becoming individually playable in
                accordance with the story as they traverse an open world New York City and fight enemies.[3] Players can
                acquire new abilities and collect various Spider-Man suits. Peter and Miles can be freely swapped
                between at any point during free-roam in the game's open world, and have dedicated missions both in the
                main story and as part of side content that takes advantage of their individual traits.[4] The game
                expands upon the prior entries' open world, allowing players to explore Brooklyn and Queens in addition
                to Manhattan, which was the main setting of the previous two games.[5]

                Building on the combat system of the previous titles, both Spider-Men are able to parry physical
                attacks, as certain enemy types are impervious to dodging. During traversal, both Peter and Miles' new
                suits come equipped with Web Wings, which, when deployed, allow them to glide across the city, with
                their speed and distance covered increasing when taking advantage of areas such as wind tunnels. Each
                Spider-Man's gadget wheel has been upgraded with additional equippable mods for their web-shooters, such
                as being able to cast a Web Line across pillars for additional footing during stealth sequences
                suspended above enemies, and the Web Grabber, allowing multiple enemies to be pulled into an isolated
                spot for Stealth Takedowns, which can be performed on two enemies at once. In addition to Peter Parker's
                standard gameplay, he is playable when bonded to the Venom symbiote, granting him tendrils that he can
                use in combat and unique web-based abilities.[6] Both Spider-Men have individual Skill Trees with
                additional unlockable abilities for both of them once they accumulate enough Skill Points in accordance
                with their experience level, as well as a third Skill Tree dedicated to shared abilities between them.
