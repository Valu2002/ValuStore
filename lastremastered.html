            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>In 2013, an outbreak of a mutant Cordyceps fungus ravages the United States, transforming its human hosts
                into aggressive creatures. In the suburbs of Austin, Texas, Joel (Troy Baker) flees the chaos with his
                brother, Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce), and daughter, Sarah (Hana Hayes). As they flee, Sarah is shot by a
                soldier and dies in Joel's arms.

                Twenty years later, civilization has been decimated by the infection. Joel works as a smuggler with his
                partner, Tess (Annie Wersching), in a quarantine zone in Boston, Massachusetts. They hunt down Robert
                (Robin Atkin Downes), a black-market dealer, to recover a stolen weapons cache. Before Tess kills him,
                Robert reveals he traded the cache with the Fireflies, a rebel militia opposing the quarantine zone
                authorities. The Fireflies' leader, Marlene (Merle Dandridge), promises to double their cache in return
                for smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie (Ashley Johnson), to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State
                House. While sneaking out at night, Joel and Tess discover Ellie is infected; she claims she is immune
                and may lead to a cure. At the State House, the trio discover the Fireflies have been killed and Tess
                reveals she has been infected. Believing in Ellie's importance, she sacrifices herself against pursuing
                soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he
                can locate others.

                With the help of Bill (W. Earl Brown), a smuggler and survivalist in Lincoln, Massachusetts, Joel and
                Ellie acquire a working vehicle. Driving into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Joel and Ellie are ambushed by
                bandits and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji
                Jeter). After they escape the city, Sam is bitten but hides it from the group. As his infection takes
                hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead before taking his own life.

                In the fall, Joel and Ellie find Tommy in Jackson, Wyoming, where he has assembled a fortified
                settlement near a hydroelectric dam with his wife, Maria (Ashley Scott). Joel leaves Ellie with Tommy,
                but after she confronts him about Sarah, he lets her stay. Tommy directs them to a Firefly enclave at
                the University of Eastern Colorado. They find the university abandoned but learn the Fireflies have
                moved to a hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah. The two are attacked by bandits and Joel is severely
                wounded while escaping.

                During the winter, Ellie and Joel shelter in the mountains. Joel is on the brink of death and relies on
                Ellie to care for him. Hunting for food, Ellie encounters David (Nolan North) and James (Reuben
                Langdon), scavengers willing to trade medicine for food. After David reveals the university bandits were
                part of his group, Ellie becomes hostile. She leads David's group away from Joel but is captured; David
                intends to recruit her into his cannibal group. Ellie escapes after killing James, but David corners her
                in a burning restaurant. Meanwhile, Joel recovers from his wounds and sets out to find Ellie. He reaches
                her just as she kills David with a machete, an act that traumatizes her, and Joel comforts her before
                they flee.

                In the spring, Joel and Ellie arrive in Salt Lake City. Ellie is rendered unconscious after almost
                drowning before they are captured by a Firefly patrol. In the hospital, Marlene tells Joel that Ellie is
                being prepared for surgery: in hopes of producing a vaccine for the infection, the Fireflies must remove
                the infected portion of Ellie's brain, which will kill her. Unwilling to let Ellie die, Joel battles his
                way to the operating room, and kills the lead surgeon. Joel carries the unconscious Ellie to the parking
                garage, where he is confronted by Marlene, whom he shoots dead to prevent the Fireflies from pursuing
                them. On the drive out of the city, when Ellie wakes up, Joel lies and tells her that the Fireflies had
                found other immune people but were unable to create a cure and have stopped trying. On the outskirts of
                Tommy's settlement, Ellie expresses her survivor guilt. At her insistence, Joel swears his story about
                the Fireflies is true.</p>

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>The Last of Us is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective.[1] The player
                traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as towns, buildings, forests, and sewers to advance the
                story. The player can use firearms, improvised weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and stealth to defend
                against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus.
                For most of the game, the player takes control of Joel, a man tasked with escorting a young girl, Ellie,
                across the United States.[2] The player also controls Ellie throughout the game's winter segment[3] and
                briefly controls Joel's daughter, Sarah, in the opening sequence.
                In combat, the player can use long-range weapons, such as a rifle, a shotgun, and a bow, and short-range
                weapons such as a handgun and a short-barreled shotgun. The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee
                weapons, such as pipes and baseball bats, and throw bottles and bricks to distract, stun, or attack
                enemies.[6] The player can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items. Equipment such as
                health kits, shivs, and Molotov cocktails can be found or crafted using collected items. Attributes such
                as the health meter and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants. Health
                can be recharged by finding edible items or through the use of health kits.[7]

                Though the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak
                by them. "Listen Mode" allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and
                spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects.[5] In the dynamic cover
                system, the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain a tactical advantage during combat.[8] The game
                features periods without combat, often involving conversation between the characters.[9] The player can
                solve simple puzzles, such as using floating pallets to move Ellie, who is unable to swim, across bodies
                of water and using ladders or dumpsters to reach higher areas. Story collectibles, such as notes, maps
                and comics, can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu.[10]

                The game features an artificial intelligence system by which hostile human enemies react to combat. If
                enemies discover the player, they may take cover or call for assistance, and can take advantage of the
                player when they are distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight. Player companions, such as Ellie, can
                assist in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them, announcing the location of unseen enemies,
                or using a knife and pistol to attack enemies.
