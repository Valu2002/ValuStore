            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>The player character, known as "the Wanderer", is drugged by villagers corrupted by Lilith and fed petals
                of her blood, creating a connection to her. After escaping, the Wanderer meets Lorath Nahr (Ralph
                Ineson), one of the last Horadrim (returning from Diablo III: Reaper of Souls) and explains the prophecy
                of Lilith's return. Inarius believes he alone can fulfill the prophecy by killing Lilith, which will
                allow him to return to Heaven. Aided by a young woman named Neyrelle (Judy Alice Lee), the Wanderer
                enters the sanctum of Rathma, the first Nephalem and founder of the Necromancers. Inside, Rathma's
                spirit (Scott Whyte) reveals he had a key to Hell. When Inarius demands the key from him, Rathma
                refuses, and Inarius kills him; Lilith later finds the key. The Wanderer then journeys to Scosglen to
                meet another Horadrim named Donan (James Goode), who had defeated a demon called Astaroth (David Lodge)
                with the aid of two Druids years before. Lilith corrupts the two Druids to find Astaroth's prison and
                frees him, in exchange for safe passage through Hell. Astaroth possesses Donan's son Yorin (Thierry
                Mabonga), who dies when the demon is defeated. Donan recovers the Soulstone used to trap Astaroth, and
                prepares to alter it in order to trap Lilith.

                Rejoining Lorath in the Dry Steppes, the Wanderer pursues Lorath's former apprentice Elias (Anthony
                Howell), who summoned Lilith to Sanctuary. Though Elias cannot be killed, the Wanderer and Lorath
                retrieve an artifact called the Sightless Eye to discover Lilith's plan: To summon the Lesser Evils to
                empower humanity against the Prime Evils. She also intends to consume the essence of her father Mephisto
                (Steve Blum) while he is weak, and use his power to conquer Hell. Elias uses a witch named Taissa
                (Cherise Boothe) as a vessel to summon Andariel, the Maiden of Anguish, who is defeated by the Wanderer.
                Seeking to break Elias' immortality, the Wanderer and the Horadrim journey to the swamps of Hawezar.
                Elias had claimed knowledge from an enchanted "Tree of Whispers", but failed to pay the price – his own
                head – for that knowledge. Learning that Elias has contained his life essence in his own severed finger,
                the Wanderer destroys it, before finally defeating Elias; the spirits of the Tree then claim Elias'
                head.

                From the Tree, Lorath learns of a gateway to Hell beneath the city of Caldeum, opened using Rathma's
                key. In Caldeum, the Wanderer defeats another reformed Lesser Evil, Duriel, the Lord of Pain. Inarius
                goes ahead into Hell to confront Lilith, who kills him. Donan is mortally wounded, and Lorath remains
                behind, leaving the Wanderer and Neyrelle to pursue Lilith to Mephisto's Cathedral of Hatred. Mephisto
                himself, having appeared as a bloodied wolf throughout the Wanderer's journey, urges them to focus on
                Lilith, but Neyrelle chooses to use the Soulstone to contain Mephisto instead, believing him to be the
                greater threat. The Wanderer then faces Lilith and defeats her. As she dies, Lilith warns that without
                her, there could be no victory over the Prime Evils.

                With both creators of Sanctuary dead, the party returns home. Neyrelle ventures off on her own with the
                Soulstone, knowing the Prime Evils are coming, and hoping to find a way to defeat them for good.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>The core formula for the series' gameplay revolves around gradually obtaining stronger equipment by
                defeating increasingly difficult enemies.[3] Enemies are fought using different character class skills
                which can be customized by equipment and talent trees. This concept is used to progress through the
                story and quests.[4] Enemies are split into monster families which are defined by a theme, combat style,
                and their location.[5] Each family contains different archetypes that hold different roles allowing for
                synergies of specialty abilities between family members.[5] To differentiate between them, they have
                unique silhouettes, stances and weapons.[6]

                Creative director Sebastian Stepien explained that the goal was to create a more "grounded" story than
                Diablo III.[7] In order to achieve this, the plot revolves around the simple folk of Sanctuary rather
                than "politics, kings, or another high-fantasy theme."[7]

                The playable character's effectiveness in combat is determined by their attributes and their boosts from
                equipped items.[8] Offensive attributes include attack and critical chance which increase damage output.
                Defensive stats include elemental resistance and defense which increase how much damage can be taken.[9]
                Diablo IV introduces three new attributes: Angelic, Demonic, and Ancestral Power. Angelic and Demonic
                Power alter the duration of beneficial and negative effects respectively. Ancestral Power increases the
                chance of effects being applied to another entity.[10] Weapons and gear have increasing rarity which are
                a general indicator of their power. The rarest items have unique effects that alter more than just the
                character's parameters.[11] In an interview with lead game designer Joe Shely and senior producer
                Tiffany Wat, it was revealed that trading and crafting will be available in the game but will be limited
                to resources outside of the most powerful items.[12] Limited-time seasons return to the game, which
                alter legendary powers to shift the meta-game.[13][clarification needed]

                Microtransactions are included in the form of cosmetic items.[14] The game cannot be played offline and
                requires an internet connection.
