            <p>Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale-hero shooter game developed by Respawn Entertainment and
                published by Electronic Arts. It was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in February 2019,
                for Nintendo Switch in March 2021, and for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in March 2022. A mobile
                version of the game designed for touchscreens titled Apex Legends Mobile was released in May 2022 on
                Android and iOS. The game supports cross-platform play, excluding the aforementioned mobile platforms.

                Before the match, players form into two- or three-player squads, and select from pre-designed characters
                with distinctive abilities, known as "Legends". The game has two gameplay modes. In "Battle Royale", up
                to 20 three-person squads or 30 two-person duos land on an island and search for weapons and supplies
                before attempting to defeat all other players in combat. The available play area on the island shrinks
                over time, forcing players to keep moving or else find themselves outside the play area which can be
                fatal. The final team alive wins the round. In "Arenas", players form into three-player squads and fight
                against another squad in a 3v3 team deathmatch over a series of rounds to determine the winner of the
                match. Teams win when their team has at least 3 points and is 2 points ahead.

                Apex Legends is set in the same science fiction universe as Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall series,
                with several characters from the Titanfall series appearing either as minor characters or playable
                Legends. Work on the game began around late 2016, though the project remained a secret right up until
                its launch. The game's release in 2019 came as a surprise, as until that point it had been assumed that
                Respawn Entertainment was working on a third installment to the Titanfall franchise, the studio's
                previous major game. Apex Legends received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its
                gameplay, progression system, and fusion of elements from various genres. Some considered it a worthy
                competitor to other battle royale games. Apex Legends surpassed 25 million players by the end of its
                first week, and 50 million within its first month. By April 2021, it had approximately 100 million
                players making it one of the most played video games of all time by player count.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>Apex Legends is an online multiplayer battle royale game featuring squads of three players using pre-made
                characters with distinctive abilities, called "Legends", similar to those of hero shooters.[1] Alternate
                modes have been introduced allowing for single and for two-player squads since the game's release.[2][3]
                The game is free-to-play and monetized through microtransactions and loot boxes, which allow the player
                to spend both real money and in-game currency on cosmetic items, such as outfits for the Legends and new
                colors for weapons.[4][5]

                Each match generally features twenty teams of three-player squads. Players can join friends in a squad
                or can be matched randomly with other players. Before the match, each player on the squad selects one of
                the 25 playable characters (as of season 19), with the exception that no character may be selected more
                than once by a squad. Each character in the squad has a unique design, personality, and abilities that
                provide different playstyles to the team. Starting with Season 16, each legend is assigned to one of the
                five unique class styles: Assault, Skirmisher, Recon, Controller and Support. All teams are then placed
                on an aircraft that passes over the game map. One player in each squad is the jumpmaster, selecting when
                the squad should skydive out of the aircraft and where to land with the concurrence of the other squad
                members. However, players are free to deviate from the squad's path.

                Once on the ground, the squad can scavenge for weapons, armor, and other equipment that is scattered
                around buildings, or in crates randomly distributed around the map, while keeping an eye out for other
                squads. Apex Legends includes a nonverbal communication "ping system" which allows players to use their
                game controller to communicate to their squad certain directions, weapon locations, enemies, and
                suggested strategies.[6] While the game offers movement options similar to other shooters, it includes
                some of the gameplay features of previous Titanfall games, such as the ability to climb over short
                walls, slide down inclined surfaces, and use zip-lines to traverse an area quickly.
