            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>In 1695, Banishers and lovers Antea Duarte and Ruaidhrigh "Red" mac Raith travel to colonial New England
                to answer the call of their friend Charles Davenport to banish a particularly powerful curse afflicting
                the town of New Eden. The pair discover that the curse has trapped New Eden in an eternal winter and has
                claimed the lives of many townsfolk, including Charles himself. They meet the town leaders - Governor
                Fairefax Haskell, huntress Thickskin Newsmith, and Captain Saul Pennington - as well as Charles' widow
                Esther. Antea summons Charles' ghost, who warns her that a Nightmare, the rarest and most powerful type
                of ghost, has come to haunt New Eden. Antea then reluctantly convinces Charles to take his ascent to the
                afterlife and leave the mortal realm forever. Later that night, Antea and Red attempt to confront the
                Nightmare, but she easily overpowers them both, killing Antea and throwing Red off a cliff.

                Red awakes in a cave, having been saved by the witch Seeker under orders from her master Siridean.
                Seeker and Red parts ways, leaving Red to find his way back to New Eden himself. He then finds Antea's
                ghost, who agrees to help him take revenge on the Nightmare so that they can recover her body and she
                can properly ascend. However, Red also considers performing a dark ritual that requires human sacrifice
                in order to resurrect Antea. They come across survivors led by Thickskin and sister Kate who fled New
                Eden, which is now fully under the Nightmare's control. They banish an evil spirit haunting the area,
                only to discover that Thickskin culled the "weak" members of her group while Kate is complicit in her
                lover Deborah Comenius being executed as a witch. Red then makes the choice of either sparing or
                sacrificing Thickskin for her crimes. Later, the pair are led by Seeker to meet Siridean herself.
                Siridean explains that the pair need to weaken the Nightmare by destroying her fragments that roam the
                outskirts of New Eden, and then confront the Nightmare directly in the Void where she is vulnerable.

                Red and Antea then travel around the outskirts of New Eden, where they encounter other New Eden survivor
                groups led by Haskell and Pennington. However, in their investigations to solve the hauntings plaguing
                the groups, the pair uncover evidence that both Haskell and Pennington were chiefly responsible for the
                wrongful arrest, trial, and execution of Deborah as a witch, blaming her as the source of a plague that
                ravaged New Eden several years ago. The Nightmare is actually Deborah's vengeful spirit, returned to
                take her revenge on all of New Eden. Red has the choice of either sparing or sacrificing Haskell and
                Pennington for their crimes. During this time, Siridean passes away from old age, but not before warning
                Red and Antea that they must make sure they both desire the same thing.</p>
