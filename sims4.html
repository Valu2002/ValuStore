            <summary>Description</summary>
            <p>The Sims 4 is a free-to-play social simulation game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts.
                It is the fourth major title in The Sims series, following The Sims 3 (2009). The game was released in
                North America on September 2, 2014, for Windows, an OS X version was released in February 2015, and
                PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions were released in November 2017. The game was moved to a free-to-play
                model on October 18, 2022, monetized by the purchase of various paid downloadable content packs that
                have been developed since its release.

                Like previous titles in the series, The Sims 4 allows players to create and dress characters called
                "Sims", build and furnish houses for them, and simulate their everyday lives. The game introduces a
                newly developed custom game engine, with improved character creation and housebuilding tools, as well as
                deeper in-game simulation with the new emotion and personality systems for Sims.

                Development of The Sims 4 began as an online multiplayer title, but plans were shifted to a
                single-player experience following the negative launch reception of Maxis' SimCity in 2013. In the
                months leading up to the game's release, Maxis revealed that several features present in prior The Sims
                main titles would be omitted at launch, citing insufficient development time and technical complexity;
                this was received negatively by players. The Sims 4 received mixed reviews from critics upon its initial
                release, who praised the game's visual design, improved AI simulation for Sims, and the simplified
                building tools, but criticized the lack of content compared to prior The Sims titles, frequent loading
                screens, glitches, and missing features.

                The Sims 4 has been commercially successful, topping the all-format video game chart in 2014, and has
                received over 70 million players worldwide as of 2023, making it the most popular game in the franchise.
                Development of the game has been supported with numerous paid downloadable content packs, namely fifteen
                expansion packs, twelve game packs, and several stuff packs and kits. The most recent expansion pack,
                The Sims 4: For Rent, was released on December 7, 2023. Free content updates introducing and expanding
                major features have also been released, such as swimming pools, more character customization options,
                more building tools, and gameplay scenarios. A new mainline The Sims title, under the working title
                "Project Rene", is currently in development.

            <summary>Gameplay</summary>
            <p>The Sims 4 is a social simulation game, similar to preceding titles in the series. There is no primary
                objective or goal to achieve, and instead of fulfilling objectives, the player is encouraged to make
                choices and engage fully in an interactive environment.[2][3] The focus of the game is on the simulated
                lives of virtual people called "Sims", and the player is responsible for directing their actions,
                attending to their "Needs", and helping them attain their desires.[2] Although it is not mandatory,
                objective-based gameplay is available if the player desires, with each Sim having lifelong aspirations,
                and "wants and fears" personal goals that are generated based on current gameplay.[2][4]

                Simoleons (§) are the unit of currency used in the game, and Sims communicate in a fictional language
                called Simlish.[5] Sims have six needs: hunger, bladder, hygiene, social, fun, and energy. These needs
                are drained as the Sim progresses through an in-game day, and are refilled by various household items
                and furniture. Sims primarily make money by getting a job, or selling crafted items such as paintings
                and garden produce,[2] and Sims need to develop skills for jobs and crafting items; for example, Sims in
                the Culinary career track need to be proficient in the Cooking skill. The game includes a comprehensive
                list of cheats, such as infinite money and hidden gameplay options.[2][6] Paid downloadable content
                (DLC) packs expand the number of features, objects, worlds, and gameplay options available to play
                with.[7]

                The OS X and Windows versions of The Sims 4 include extensive modding support, as in previous mainline
                The Sims games.[8][9][10] There are two types of player-developed mod content: script mods and custom
                content. Script mods typically modify gameplay behavior or add gameplay mechanics,[11] while custom
                content encompasses cosmetic items including custom hairstyles, makeup, clothing, and furniture.
